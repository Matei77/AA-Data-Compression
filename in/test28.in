Ohh, no. Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing?

But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Doc? McFly.

No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. Ah, where're my pants? Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her.

Yoo. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed. Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you.

Save the clock tower. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. What? A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955.

Yeah. Just finishing up the second coat now. Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. Shit.

I will. Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... Who is that guy. Jennifer. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing?

Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. What? Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. Well, I guess that's everything. Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you.

Ahh. What about George? Your, your right. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? Thanks a lot, kid.

Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. This is for all you lovers out there. I have a feeling too. The keys are in the trunk. Yeah.

I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. Ah, where're my pants? Marty, will we ever see you again? Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him.

Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind. I've gotta go. Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. Right check, Doc.

That ain't no airplane, look. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Does your mom know about tomorrow night? Listen, Doc.

Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- Right check, Doc. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload.

I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. That's good advice, Marty. Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. Hello.

Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets. Precisely. Mom, Dad. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy.

What Lorraine, what? Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Precisely. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc

What Lorraine, what? Actually, people call me Marty. I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? It's my dad. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

Huh? Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? Hello. What did you say? Oh, yeah, yeah.

Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.

And where's my reports? Marty, such a nice name. C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. We do now. That's George McFly?

Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. Okay Doc, this is it. George. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Just finishing up the second coat now.

The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? This sounds pretty heavy. Did you hurt your head? That's good advice, Marty.

Doc, wait. No, bastards. It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking. I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance.

What was it, George, bird watching? What's that thing he's on? Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine.

The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. You bet. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside-

Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car.

It's a board with wheels. Yeah, it's in the back. Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. That's right, he's gonna be mayor. No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun.

Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. What did I just say? Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? Holy shit.

That's good advice, Marty. Right. Marty, such a nice name. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? You know what I do in those situations?

No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. Where were we. Marty, is that you? How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't.

It's already mutated into human form, shoot it. This is for all you lovers out there. No, fine, no , good, fine, good. That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe.

No. Are you gonna order something, kid? This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?

I followed you. That's a great idea. I'd love to park. Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium.

Whoa, whoa, okay. Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Nothing's coming to my mind. How about a ride, Mister?

Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. That's a big bruise you have there. Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her. Mom, Dad.

Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine. Doc, she didn't even look at him. You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain.

Yeah, it's in the back. Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning. I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. Bet your ass it works. Your, your right.

Leave her alone, you bastard. I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. Yeah, it's in the back.

Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you. What about George? You too. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be.

Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. Working. Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas.

The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Chuck, Chuck, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Berry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive.

Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. The hell you doing to my car? Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. Uh, coast guard. Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man.

Right about here. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. No, why, what's a matter? Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. Hello, Jennifer.

Whoa, whoa, okay. Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. Mom, Dad.

Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line. Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father. Well, she's not doing a very good job. Thanks, thanks a lot. Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me.

Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? What the hell is a gigawatt? Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her-

No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? C'mon.

I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. What? I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you.

What a nightmare. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. Quiet. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here.

Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. Holy shit. Why am I always the last one to know about these things. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody.

Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. Hey. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. Yoo. You got a permit for that?

whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Ah, where're my pants? That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything.

That's right, he's gonna be mayor. Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you. Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? Right.

Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. Weight has nothing to do with it. It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. Doc, you gotta help-

Good morning. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go.

Okay, but I don't know what to say. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. That's good advice, Marty.

No, why, what's a matter? This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. You too. Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon.

Um, yeah, I'm on my way. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history.

What? Do you mind if we park for a while? Yeah, it's in the back. Are you sure about this storm? What Lorraine, what?

Say that again. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. Excuse me. Its good. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home.

Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning. Why not? We do now. Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? I think we need a rematch.

Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. What the hell is this? Just finishing up the second coat now. Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? Yeah, he's right here.

Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? What, what, ma? Marty, are you alright? See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. Biff.

Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. It's a board with wheels. What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age. Thanks a lot, kid. George.

C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. C'mon, c'mon let's go. Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. Yeah, where does he live?

Say that again. Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon. You know what I do in those situations? Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god.

Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. Back to the future. I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Jesus.

Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. God dammit, I'm late. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born.

No, fine, no , good, fine, good. Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. Don't say a word. Oh. About how far ahead are you going?

What? Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch.

That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. Who do you think, the Libyans. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? Well, uh, listen, uh, I really- Which one's your pop?

It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father. You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.

A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. Yeah, gimme a Tab. That's for messing up my hair. Well yeah, you know we have two of them.

How's your head? You do? Excuse me. You okay, is everything alright? You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it.

Next, please. Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. I just wanna use the phone. Who? Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet.

This sounds pretty heavy. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. I have to tell you about the future. What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age. Mom, is that you?

What did you say? That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him- Marty, that was very interesting music. Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind-

Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? Yeah. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. Flux capacitor.

Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks. Mom, Dad. Hi, Marty.

George. Good morning. I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. Yeah, where does he live? This sounds pretty heavy.

Maybe you were adopted. Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. Who do you think, the Libyans. You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. Uh, Doc.

The flux capacitor. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. Biff. George. Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that?

C'mon. Uh? You too. How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. I just wanna use the phone.

One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. Biff. What, what, ma? Uh, Doc. Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him.

You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? Doc, you gotta help- Hey. Where's Einstein, is he with you?

Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. No, bastards. Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. Nothing. Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet.

Ohh, no. Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... Keys? I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. You're gonna be in the car with her.

Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. Let's get him. Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. Wait a minute.

What did you sleep in your clothes again last night. Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? Jesus, you smoke too? Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home.

Chuck, Chuck, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Berry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this. Does your mom know about tomorrow night? What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him-

Breakfast. No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you. Right, gimme a Pepsi free. You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him.

Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? Excuse me. Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc. Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me.

Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. Right. Right. Marty. Marty. Marty. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you.

Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible.

Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. Ah, where're my pants? No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- Good morning, Mom. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly?

I have a feeling too. Ah, honey, your first novel. Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? Marty, is that you? I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch.

Scram, McFly. About 30 years, it's a nice round number. Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Because, you might regret it later in life.

I think you got the wrong car, McFly. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.

Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine. Ah, honey, your first novel. Actually, people call me Marty. Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here?

Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? Because, you might regret it later in life. You'll find out in thirty years. Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts.

I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? That's George McFly? I'm writing this down, this is good stuff.

Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. Right check, Doc. Aw yeah, everything is great.

I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. Say that again. Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around.

Hello. Marty, you made it. Bet your ass it works. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. Say that again.

Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind. C'mon, c'mon let's go. Ah. Whoa. Oh, what I meant to day was- Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin.

What, what? No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. What about George? Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you.

God dammit, I'm late. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Ah. Whoa. Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear?

Shit. That's right, he's gonna be mayor. I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. You're George McFly.

Save the clock tower. Precisely. Wrecked? When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you.

Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright? I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. Your, your right. Ah, where're my pants? You're gonna be in the car with her.

Hi. Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social- Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear? Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something?

That ain't no airplane, look. I can't play. Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. What did I just say? Why not?

Ahh. Hello. Are you gonna order something, kid? Marty, is that you? I have a feeling too.

Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? In that case, I'll tell you strait out. One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. You do?

Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. Uncle Jailbird Joey? Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life.

Do you mind if we park for a while? Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. Who is that guy.

Huh? Oh. But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying. What did I just say? Save the clock tower.

What? Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? What's a rerun? Leave her alone, you bastard. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?

I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. Marty, will we ever see you again? Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. I will.

Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. Yeah, it's 8:00. What you got under here? Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. Huh?

McFly. No, bastards. Right. Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. Jesus, you smoke too?

Yeah, where does he live? The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. Why do you keep following me around? Ahh.

Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance. Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me.

I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? What did your mother ever see in that kid? Yeah well, you shouldn't drink. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything.

Never? Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.

I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Yeah. Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody. Yeah.

Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? Uh, yeah. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon.

What did I just say? C'mon. You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. Lorraine. Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear?

Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. No, fine, no , good, fine, good. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet.

Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. Scram, McFly. That's good advice, Marty. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed. Excuse me.

Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. Whoa, whoa, okay. I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Yeah okay.

Right. Well gee, I don't know. You don't understand. Wait a minute. In that case, I'll tell you strait out.

Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility.

George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? Are you sure about this storm? Why am I always the last one to know about these things. Yeah, it's in the back. What?

What, what, ma? Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Yeah, he's right here. It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking.

Who are you? Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? How's your head? Right, and where am I gonna be?

That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking. Uh, well, I gotta go. The storm. Doc.

Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day? Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. Are you gonna order something, kid? Yeah, I think maybe you do.

Um, yeah, I'm on my way. I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Calvin. What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else.

I just wanna use the phone. What the hell is a gigawatt? George. George. I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- What?

How's your head? Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. Damn. I'm late for school. I think I know exactly what you mean. You're gonna be in the car with her.

Looks like a airplane, without wings. Ronald Reagon. You too. Hello. Uh, well, I gotta go.

C'mon, c'mon let's go. The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. Who's are these?

Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines. I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours.

Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. Leave her alone, you bastard. What, what, ma? Look, you gotta listen to me. Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.

Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. And where's my reports? What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. No, fine, no , good, fine, good. Right, I got it.

It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. Thanks, thanks a lot. Right. Save the clock tower. Nothing.

Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? George: you ever think of running for class president? George. No, not yet. My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines.

God dammit, I'm late. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay? Yeah.

Hi, Marty. You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. Working. Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein.

Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you. Leave me alone. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing?

Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. Back to the future. Oh. We never would have fallen in love. I guarantee it.

Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature. What the hell is this? Damn. I'm late for school. George, aren't you gonna kiss me?

No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. This is for all you lovers out there. I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance.

he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. We all make mistakes in life, children Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. C'mon.

Oh. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? Oh. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater.

Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Huh? Well uh, good, fine. Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line. Yeah, it's in the back.

Lorraine, are you up there? Yeah. I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. Why do you keep following me around? Ahh.

Hey. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall?

Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. Stop it. Yeah. Ahh. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance.

Do you mind if we park for a while? Nothing's coming to my mind. Where were we. He's a peeping tom. Dad. Hello.

Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day. Ronald Reagon. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks.

Oh, yeah, yeah. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- Uh, look me up when you get there. Yeah okay. Okay.

Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? Leave me alone. Really. Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him.

Oh, just a little weather experiment. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. Biff. What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age.

He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Looks like a airplane, without wings. Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day. Oh, just a little weather experiment.

Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. Doc, you gotta help- Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Well, Biff.

Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. Yeah. Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new.

No. Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Yeah. Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me? Yeah, who are you?

oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. Yeah. Hello. Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind. What?

I, I don't know. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. Hi. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive.

Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Lorenzo, where're you keys? Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. Children. Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing.

Well, this is a radiation suit. C'mon, c'mon let's go. I guarantee it. Okay. No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody.

Oh. Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date. Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine. I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?

What? Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? C'mon, c'mon let's go. Alright, take it up, go. Doc.

Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. That's George McFly. How about a ride, Mister? So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.

Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? A colored mayor, that'll be the day. Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. Flux capacitor. What's a rerun?

A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. It's already mutated into human form, shoot it. Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? What Lorraine, what? I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed.

What's with the life preserver? Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. Yeah well, you shouldn't drink.

George. George. Stop it. Yeah, sure, okay. Leave her alone, you bastard. No, Doc.

Perfect, just perfect. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? I followed you. I think we need a rematch. Hello.

No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible. Doc. Hello. Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. Look, you gotta listen to me.

Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope.

Are you sure about this storm? 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.

Okay, but I don't know what to say. Hi. You're George McFly. Jesus. Oh.

Oh. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? You got a permit for that? You broke it. Wow, look at him go.

You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc. You're George McFly. Oh, just a little weather experiment. Unroll their fire. Oh.

I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. Well, this is a radiation suit. Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book.

You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show. Yoo. Hi. No. No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids.

What? Calvin. Doc. Don't tell me anything. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance.

I haven't Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. What was it, George, bird watching? Oh. Mom, Dad.

Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. Ahh.

That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. Yeah, he's right here. How about a ride, Mister? Uh, Doc. Well, I guess that's everything.

Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. No. Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. Biff.

Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. Hello, Jennifer. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Ah.

Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Well gee, I don't know. I'm gonna be at the dance. Doc. What about George?

Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here? I'm gonna ram him. I have to tell you about the future. Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. I can't play.

Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug. Ah, where're my pants? Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future.

Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- Jennifer. Well, Biff.

Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day. Uh, coast guard. Never mind that now, never mind that now. That's a great idea. I'd love to park. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post?

Aw yeah, everything is great. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. Yoo. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet.

Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book.

That's George McFly. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. I think I know exactly what you mean. Ah. Whoa. What?

This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show. Right. Why is she gonna get angry with you? You'll find out.

Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning. I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- Okay. No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin.

Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. I have to tell you about the future. What?

Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. Holy shit. McFly. Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans.

Children. That's a great idea. I'd love to park. Okay. Stop it. That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor.

Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. Doc, she didn't even look at him.

Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine. You're George McFly. Marty, you made it. You'll find out.

Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? Are you okay? Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life.

Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. Well, they're bigger than me.

Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. Oh, yeah, yeah. Excuse me. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin.

No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids. Oh. Uncle Jailbird Joey? Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible.

It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? Nothing. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties.

Well, uh, listen, uh, I really- I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible. Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy.

We never would have fallen in love. Excuse me. Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it. Well, I guess that's everything. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this.

Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day? Oh. Ahh. Ahh. Don't say a word. Marty, you made it.

So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? Precisely. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there?

Hello. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday. Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. Yeah, who are you?

Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series. Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? Scram, McFly.

He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. What, what? No, not yet. Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till-

Oh yes sir. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. You too.

Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me? Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?

Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. Excuse me. Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day? Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me? Alright, take it up, go. Doc.

Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. Who are you? Ahh. You'll find out.

Working. What's the meaning of this. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. Right, I got it. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.

It's my dad. Your, your right. He's a very strange young man. Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple.

What, I don't get what happened. Well, I figured, what the hell. Breakfast. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean.

Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? George. George. Well yeah, you know we have two of them. Yeah, well history is gonna change. It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking.

You're George McFly. We do now. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake. Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars. What?

Perfect, just perfect. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine. Thanks. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy.

Take care. Never mind that now, never mind that now. Um, yeah, I'm on my way. Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner.

Ohh, no. Marty. Marty. Marty. Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. She's just trying to keep you respectable. Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television.

No, Doc. Jesus. Your, your right. What? Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is?

Lorenzo, where're you keys? Where does he come from? Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. No, bastards. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance.

I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? this has gotta be a dream. George. George. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked.

What about George? Oh, what I meant to day was- The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.

Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? This is for all you lovers out there. Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me? No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. This sounds pretty heavy.

Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Good morning, Mom. I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? The hell you doing to my car?

Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance. Oh. Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked.

Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. Listen, Doc. Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. Wow, you must be rich. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it.

Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature. Right. Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. Leave me alone. Um, well it's a delorean, right?

Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? Yeah. Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here? It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet.

A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike. Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. Is she pretty? George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home.

Stop it. Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Yeah.

Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature. That's a big bruise you have there. What? Say that again. Jennifer.

Next, please. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Marty, is that you? Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television.

Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you? Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. Jesus, you smoke too?

The hell you doing to my car? Marty, such a nice name. Children. Actually, people call me Marty. What?

Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. I've gotta go. Why do you keep following me around? Don't tell me anything. A colored mayor, that'll be the day.

Ah well, sort of. Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? What's that thing he's on? Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it.

Do you mind if we park for a while? You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother? I think I know exactly what you mean. You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother? Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.

I said the keys are in here. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. Just finishing up the second coat now. Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver.

Uh? You too. What? Its good. Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh.

Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine. Well, Biff. Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. Doc, you gotta help-

You do? Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here? Well, she's not doing a very good job.

Children. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. Whoa, whoa, okay.

Oh. Where the hell are they. You bet. Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. What the hell is this?

Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row. I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines. Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? Where were we.

Huh? Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. No.

Yeah, gimme a Tab. Look, you gotta listen to me. Why am I always the last one to know about these things. Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.

This is for all you lovers out there. Lorenzo, where're you keys? Oh, yeah, yeah. It's a board with wheels. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born.

Jennifer. Yeah. I can't play. Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. That's a great idea. I'd love to park.

Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. Good morning. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? Will you take care of that? Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me.

Yet. Biff. Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. Oh. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.

I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. Ahh. Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? What, well you mean like a date?

And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. Why do you keep following me around? he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you?

Huh? That's right, he's gonna be mayor. Um, yeah, I'm on my way. I think we need a rematch. Right check, Doc.

Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight. Excuse me. What, what? Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books?

So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... George, help me, please. Lorraine, are you up there? That's a great idea. I'd love to park.

It's already mutated into human form, shoot it. Ahh. Ahh. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. Who?

After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it. Who's are these? Science Fiction Theater. Marty. Marty. Marty.

Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? Ah, honey, your first novel. The storm. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy.

Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after. Uh? What's that thing he's on? Scram, McFly. I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly.

Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? I just wanna use the phone. Marty, will we ever see you again? Oh. Quiet.

Leave her alone, you bastard. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? Yoo.

Jesus, you smoke too? Uh, I think so. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Watch it, Goldie. So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985?

Really. Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? I've gotta go. Right, I got it. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe.

The hell you doing to my car? I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date. Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. Where?

Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her. He's a very strange young man.

Children. Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda Its good. My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines. Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan.

C'mon. No, why, what's a matter? Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date. I'm gonna ram him.

Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Marty, you made it. Whoa, this is heavy. Marty, such a nice name.

Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? How about a ride, Mister? Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake. Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars. Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. This sounds pretty heavy.

Lorraine, are you up there? I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. Ahh. How about a ride, Mister?

What did I just say? What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age. Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. Marty, is that you?

Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. Right, I got it. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? I'm gonna ram him.

You bet. Alright, take it up, go. Doc. Wrecked? When did this happen and- You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble.

Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating?

Excuse me. McFly. Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? Nothing. Actually, people call me Marty.

Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. I said the keys are in here.

No. Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. Um, yeah, I'm on my way. Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it.

Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series. I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car.

Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Unroll their fire. You do? Let's go. Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand.

Yoo. Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo Keys? Go. Go. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.

Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. About 30 years, it's a nice round number. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head.

How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. That's him. He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches.

Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? Oh, just a little weather experiment. Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him-

You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Oh, what I meant to day was- What? Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean.

Stop it. Shit. Right. Right. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing?

Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. He's your brother, Mom. No, Biff, you leave her alone. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. You okay, is everything alright?

Quiet. I think you got the wrong car, McFly. Unroll their fire. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. He's alright.

Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now. Wrecked? Oh yes sir. Precisely.

Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. You're gonna be in the car with her.

I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. Crazy drunk drivers. That's George McFly. I'll get it back to you, alright? Yeah well, you shouldn't drink.

Say that again. Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. Stop it. Right, and where am I gonna be? What you got under here?

Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? Oh, yeah, yeah. Are those my clocks I hear? Well, uh, listen, uh, I really- This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future.

What, I don't get what happened. Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? Quiet. What about George? What you got under here?

I'm gonna be at the dance. Well yeah, you know we have two of them. I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. The flux capacitor.

What? No. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? Ahh.

Marty, why are you so nervous? Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay? Now Biff, don't con me.

That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother? Let's go.

That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. George, help me, please. Doc. C'mon, c'mon let's go. Wrecked?

Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. Looks like a airplane, without wings. Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? Yeah, it's 8:00. I have to tell you about the future.

Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. George.

Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? I can't play. You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show.

Yeah, who are you? Well, they're bigger than me. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? The flux capacitor. I haven't

Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody. Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you.

Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning?

Hey boy, are you alright? Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. Are those my clocks I hear? Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? Are you gonna order something, kid?

You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town. Doc. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going.

What a nightmare. Well, Biff. I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you?

That's George McFly. Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. You don't understand. Ahh. Uh, look me up when you get there.

Let's go. Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave. Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. Excuse me.

Well gee, I don't know. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. No, not yet.

Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. Aw yeah, everything is great. What, what is it hot? Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. Yeah.

What, I don't get what happened. What? Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car.

What? C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man. Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here.

You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age.

Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Why am I always the last one to know about these things. That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. Never mind that now, never mind that now.

I'm gonna ram him. That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible. Ohh, no. C'mon, c'mon let's go.

I think I know exactly what you mean. And he could sleep in my room. That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. Are those my clocks I hear?

I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. Alright, punk, now- Is she pretty? Don't tell me anything. One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott.

Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? Doc? Who are you? Yeah, well history is gonna change. Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine.

Oh. Yeah, sure, okay. Yeah, it's in the back. We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay.

Yeah, gimme a Tab. No, not yet. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Oh.

Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. About how far ahead are you going? So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date?

George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. Ah, honey, your first novel. No, Doc. Uh, coast guard.

Well, this is a radiation suit. Who do you think, the Libyans. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing? This is for all you lovers out there. I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it.

What? I think we need a rematch. Next, please. Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning?

You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. Marty, are you alright? Wait a minute. Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug. Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it.

Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh. Marty, will we ever see you again? You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him.

Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. Hi, Marty. Doc.

What Lorraine, what? What, what, ma? Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you? Right about here. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood.

I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. The keys are in the trunk. Well, they're bigger than me. Uncle Jailbird Joey?

Yeah. That's George McFly? Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? Erased from existence. You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you.

Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? A colored mayor, that'll be the day. Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?

Well, she's not doing a very good job. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. Flux capacitor. Let's put him in there.

Get your meat hooks off of me. Leave her alone, you bastard. Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. What, what is it hot? No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible.

Uh, look me up when you get there. Where does he come from? How about a ride, Mister? Marty, why are you so nervous? Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name.

Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. Ah, honey, your first novel. Well, I figured, what the hell. Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- Hi, Marty.

I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy. Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. That's right.

No, Doc. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Marty, you made it. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall.

There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Yeah. I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. Now which one was it, Greg or Craig? Thanks a lot, kid.

Marty, such a nice name. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. What? Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. What about George?

What? You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike. Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake. Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars. Hey boy, are you alright?

Marty, that was very interesting music. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Alright, I'm ready. Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo What was it, George, bird watching?

What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. Yeah. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly.

You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house? Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. It's already mutated into human form, shoot it.

Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? I'm gonna ram him. Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please.

Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you. Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? Lorenzo, where're you keys? whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life.

When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh. I'm gonna be at the dance. I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. No, why, what's a matter?

Well, I figured, what the hell. Whoa, this is heavy. Well uh, good, fine. Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. Yet.

Doc, is that a de- Yeah, he's right here. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. I'm gonna be at the dance. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?

Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Well, uh, listen, uh, I really- Stop it. Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan.

Well, uh, listen, uh, I really- Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. What did you sleep in your clothes again last night. Why not? We all make mistakes in life, children

Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. Hi. Erased from existence. Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going.

Are you gonna order something, kid? Uh, yeah. Marty, will we ever see you again? No, not yet. George, help me, please.

That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car. Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her- Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine.

Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Thanks, thanks a lot. Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. His head's gone, it's like it's been erased. No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible.

Doc, she didn't even look at him. Are you okay? Its good. You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town. Marty, will we ever see you again?

1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. I think you got the wrong car, McFly. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible.

I have to tell you about the future. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. Never?

Without any sugar. What's the meaning of this. Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? You have this thing hooked up to the car? Marty, are you alright?

You'll find out in thirty years. And where's my reports? George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Marty, such a nice name. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too.

It's already mutated into human form, shoot it. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. Who, who? Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing?

Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. God dammit, I'm late. What? I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. No.

This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. You're gonna be in the car with her.

Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father. Are you sure about this storm?

Yeah. Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda Oh. I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet.

Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. Right, I got it. You do?

C'mon. Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. Ahh. Ahh. What did you say? A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike.

Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? Ahh. Marty, why are you so nervous? I think we need a rematch. Oh, yeah, yeah.

The keys are in the trunk. Who's are these? You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show. I've gotta go. Excuse me.

Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. What? Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? What? No.

I have to tell you about the future. Whoa, wait, Doc. I think we need a rematch. Really. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her.

How's your head? Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Yeah, it's 8:00. Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature.

Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? That's a great idea. I'd love to park. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun.

George. Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.

Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. George. Listen, Doc. What's going on? Where have you been all week? You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show.

I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium. Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please.

Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? I'm gonna be at the dance.

Uh, coast guard. Ahh. Ahh. Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? Where's Einstein, is he with you? Did you hurt your head?

No. Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple. What Lorraine, what? Stop it.

Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Huh? Mom, Dad. Let's get him.

So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake. Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars. Um, yeah, I'm on my way. C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Where?

Hey boy, are you alright? Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? He's a very strange young man. McFly. Yeah, he's right here.

He's a very strange young man. Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? Listen, Doc. Its good. You okay, is everything alright?

Lorraine, are you up there? The flux capacitor. Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it. Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop.

You'll find out in thirty years. Where does he come from? You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. Oh, what I meant to day was- Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall.

Who is that guy. You okay, is everything alright? Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. The keys are in the trunk. About 30 years, it's a nice round number.

That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. Right. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Let's put him in there. Doc, wait. No, bastards.

Whoa, whoa, okay. Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing?

Chuck, Chuck, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Berry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this. Which one's your pop? Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. You too. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you?

Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? No, Doc. Whoa, this is heavy. You bet.

That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series. I guarantee it. Oh, what I meant to day was- Uncle Jailbird Joey? I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed.

What, I don't get what happened. I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. That's for messing up my hair. I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. What, well you mean like a date?

Well, Biff. Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Yeah, sure, okay. Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time.

Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series. Jesus, you smoke too? Now which one was it, Greg or Craig?

Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? Wow, you must be rich. Excuse me. Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. What's that thing he's on?

We all make mistakes in life, children Uh, I think so. Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. Uh, coast guard.

You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. Working. It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple. No.

Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. You bet. Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Ahh.

Yeah. You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. Who's are these? C'mon, c'mon let's go. He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life.

Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? Mom, is that you? Its good. Look, you gotta listen to me. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble.

So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? Does your mom know about tomorrow night? Good morning. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please.

Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? Oh, yeah, yeah. What's that thing he's on?

Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. What, well you mean like a date? Uh, well, I gotta go. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny.

Say that again. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed. I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god.

Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Mom, is that you? He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn.

Save the clock tower. Doc, wait. No, bastards. You bet. Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun.

Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay? Yeah, sure, okay. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. Well yeah, you know we have two of them.

Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car. I just wanna use the phone. Who is that guy. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955.

Ahh. Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. Say that again. Thanks. Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till-

What? Thanks, thanks a lot. Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. He's your brother, Mom. Right.

Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories. Don't say a word. Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. Wrecked? When did this happen and- Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein.

Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple. Oh. He's an absolute dream. Lorraine, are you up there?

Does your mom know about tomorrow night? Yet. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.

Holy shit. Huh? Nothing. Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? Doc?

So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. Yeah, where does he live? Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. I just wanna use the phone. Oh, yeah, yeah.

Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. Who's are these? Why am I always the last one to know about these things. I hope so.

Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine. Stop it. No. What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine.

Go. Go. C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. What's a rerun? Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off?

You have this thing hooked up to the car? Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. What, what? I'm gonna be at the dance.

My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. Look, you gotta listen to me. Crazy drunk drivers.

Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Yeah, gimme a Tab. Hello. Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it.

Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. What, what? Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. What?

Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight. Really. Take care. Lorraine. C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night.

C'mon, c'mon let's go. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? Jennifer. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. I think I know exactly what you mean.

What did I just say? Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight. Well, I guess that's everything. Why am I always the last one to know about these things. What?

Hey boy, are you alright? This is for all you lovers out there. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Wait a minute. Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George?

Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her. Uh, look me up when you get there. Alright, punk, now- Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver.

Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. You do? That's George McFly?

Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.

That's him. You'll find out in thirty years. What? What? But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying.

Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine.

Really. A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike. What did you sleep in your clothes again last night. Why do you keep following me around? Which one's your pop?

Keys? Marty, such a nice name. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me?

Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. Are those my clocks I hear? Marty, is that you? I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye.

Yeah, he's right here. C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? That's George McFly.

Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Your, your right. You broke it. Wow, look at him go. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that?

Yeah, sure, okay. Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon. Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. Are you sure about this storm? Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar.

Huh? Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. What, well you mean like a date?

What's going on? Where have you been all week? My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. I, I don't know. Who, who? whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl.

Who, who? But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. Yeah. Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row.

Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. He's alright. Who is that guy. Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born.

Save the clock tower. That ain't no airplane, look. Ahh. Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you. Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda

Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. You bet.

Keys? Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Yeah. I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. We never would have fallen in love.

Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. What did you sleep in your clothes again last night. Where? Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc

Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. Your, your right. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. Who, who? Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance.

Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. Precisely. You bet. Who do you think, the Libyans. Unroll their fire.

Your, your right. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. Huh? I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me.

I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? Lorenzo, where're you keys? In that case, I'll tell you strait out. Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father.

I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. Ah, where're my pants? What? Your, your right.

After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day? Marty, will we ever see you again? Hi, Marty. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner.

Wow, you must be rich. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. Doc, is that a de- Well, uh, listen, uh, I really- That's George McFly.

Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking. Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something?

I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay? Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. I'll call you tonight. Precisely.

It's about the future, isn't it? After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Are you okay?

I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. I'm gonna be at the dance. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? Actually, people call me Marty.

Really. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. Holy shit. Let's get him. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive.

Next, please. Huh? Well, she's not doing a very good job. Quiet. Uh, look me up when you get there.

Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. That's right.

It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Yoo. Crazy drunk drivers. Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her. No, Biff, you leave her alone.

C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- No, bastards. He's an absolute dream. This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?

Children. Lorenzo, where're you keys? Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. Oh.

Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. Leave me alone. Alright, I'm ready. Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? The hell you doing to my car?

Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance.

Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. That's good advice, Marty. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny.

Okay. Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. Bet your ass it works. Are you gonna order something, kid? No, fine, no , good, fine, good.

George. Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? You're George McFly. No. That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid.

What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show. How about a ride, Mister?

Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. Marty, you made it. What a nightmare. About how far ahead are you going?

Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. Right. Well, this is a radiation suit. I'm writing this down, this is good stuff.

No, bastards. you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. Let's get him. C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks.

Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. Weight has nothing to do with it. Huh? On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. Um, well it's a delorean, right?

Doc. Well uh, good, fine. Because, you might regret it later in life. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? Wait a minute.

Yeah. I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. What's a rerun? Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it.

Perfect, just perfect. You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. Mom, Dad. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment.

Alright, we're the pinheads. What's going on? Where have you been all week? Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. Did you hurt your head? Whoa, this is heavy.

Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. He's a peeping tom. Dad. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Doc?

Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. Never mind that now, never mind that now.

Right check, Doc. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. Don't tell me anything. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine. I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me.

C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. Oh.

Ah, honey, your first novel. Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. Who is that guy. Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment.

Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. I just wanna use the phone. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance.

I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked. Oh. Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Right.

Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. She's just trying to keep you respectable.

I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. That ain't no airplane, look. Sit here, Marty. Shit. Without any sugar.

Which one's your pop? Is she pretty? Okay. Weight has nothing to do with it. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny.

What's with the life preserver? You're gonna be in the car with her. Alright, punk, now- Ahh. Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going.

Yeah. George. George, aren't you gonna kiss me? Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.

Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. George, help me, please. Wrecked? Ahh. Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her.

Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake. Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars. Lorraine. Uh? Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment.

Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? Look, you gotta listen to me. What? Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out?

That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. Yoo. Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind.

Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. He's your brother, Mom. George.

Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? Unroll their fire. A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike. You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show.

Leave her alone, you bastard. So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? You have this thing hooked up to the car? Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Whoa, wait, Doc.

Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. Because, you might regret it later in life. What, well you mean like a date? How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage.

Well uh, good, fine. Calvin. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. What, what is it hot?

Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it. One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. Precisely. Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon.

Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas...

Oh. Back to the future. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids. My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all.

Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. I think you got the wrong car, McFly. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.

Scram, McFly. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. Oh yes sir. You too.

Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Who do you think, the Libyans.

Hi, Marty. Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social- You do? Why am I always the last one to know about these things.

No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning. Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. Science Fiction Theater.

Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. I have a feeling too. No.

Save the clock tower. The flux capacitor. Um, yeah, I'm on my way. Get your meat hooks off of me. Uh, I think so.

You'll find out. I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott.

C'mon. Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. Why do you keep following me around? Unroll their fire.

Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. Lorraine. Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. He's alright.

Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. Stop it. Watch it, Goldie.

C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? I've gotta go. That's good advice, Marty. Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen.

Yeah, exactly. Right. Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here.

Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. We all make mistakes in life, children

Hey. Sit here, Marty. Um, well it's a delorean, right? Are you gonna order something, kid? This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father.

Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Thanks. That's a great idea. I'd love to park. You too. Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you.

Let's go. C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly.

This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline? Yeah, well history is gonna change. What's going on? Where have you been all week? Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? That's for messing up my hair.

But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying. I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc. Doc? Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home.

Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. Marty you gotta come back with me. Ahh. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy.

Hello. What? Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. George. C'mon.

No. Look, you gotta listen to me. Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. Right. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly.

Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? I'm gonna be at the dance. Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that?

Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. Where's Einstein, is he with you?

That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man. Yeah. I guarantee it. Yeah, it's 8:00.

You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? I will. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch.

God dammit, I'm late. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. Thanks. A colored mayor, that'll be the day.

Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town. Leave me alone. You'll find out. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that.

No, Biff, you leave her alone. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. Are you okay? Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born.

Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. Who are you? Okay. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar.

Calvin. God dammit, I'm late. God dammit, I'm late. Okay Doc, this is it. I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch.

Mom, Dad. Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car. That's right.

Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. Nothing's coming to my mind. Marty, that was very interesting music. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc.

I can't play. Yoo. Yeah, where does he live? Alright, punk, now- Huh?

Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? Never? Sit here, Marty. Well, this is a radiation suit. Well, I guess that's everything.

Why do you keep following me around? Oh, just a little weather experiment. Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. Your, your right.

Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. Okay Doc, this is it. You too. We all make mistakes in life, children A colored mayor, that'll be the day.

Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social- I've gotta go. Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future-

What's going on? Where have you been all week? What the hell is a gigawatt? My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. You broke it. Wow, look at him go. Watch it, Goldie.

I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Doc. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. Well, she's not doing a very good job.

Yeah, exactly. Uh? You know what I do in those situations? You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. Oh.

Yeah. Your, your right. Lorraine, are you up there? Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches.

What, what? Huh? Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. Doc, she didn't even look at him.

Precisely. What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age. Marty, such a nice name. Right, gimme a Pepsi free. Yet.

this has gotta be a dream. Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. I have to tell you about the future. Oh. C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks.

Let's get him. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. What, what is it hot? Stop it. Uh, look me up when you get there.

Who's are these? Hi. Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. About 30 years, it's a nice round number.

Marty, will we ever see you again? Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? Oh. Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music.

Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. I've gotta go. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed.

Never? I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. Now Biff, don't con me. Let's get him. I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat.

I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. Holy shit. C'mon.

Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin. That's him. Right, I got it.

Yet. Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here? Ahh. Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. That's right.

Good morning. Well, I figured, what the hell. Well yeah, you know we have two of them. Marty. Marty. Marty. Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean.

You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. Right check, Doc. Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? About 30 years, it's a nice round number.

Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it. Where? This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline? Yeah, it's in the back. Oh.

Right. Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing?

Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. Oh. Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?

You okay, is everything alright? Who is that guy. Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple. You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home.

Stop it. Alright, take it up, go. Doc. Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. Right, I got it.

Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. Ahh. Ahh. Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear?

Mom, Dad. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. What's going on? Where have you been all week? We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. Ahh.

I haven't Uh, I think so. Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed.

Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world.

you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. In that case, I'll tell you strait out. Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. Marty. Marty. Marty.

I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. Biff. I can't play.

Doc, wait. No, bastards. You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. No, Doc. Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny.

Huh? Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. Jennifer. Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds.

Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man.

Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- Never mind that now, never mind that now.

Which one's your pop? Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind. What, what? Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds.

Its good. Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Right. That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison.

Now which one was it, Greg or Craig? It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. And where's my reports? Right, I got it. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955.

My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines. I think you got the wrong car, McFly. Are those my clocks I hear? It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. Yeah okay.

Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son.

The future, it's where you're going? You're George McFly. You're George McFly. Perfect, just perfect. Hey.

I said the keys are in here. Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. Thanks a lot, kid. You're gonna be in the car with her. Um, yeah, I'm on my way.

George, aren't you gonna kiss me? Whoa, wait, Doc. Perfect, just perfect. C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. C'mon.

Yeah, well history is gonna change. Holy shit. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him.

Oh. Well gee, I don't know. Yeah. Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? Yeah.

Excuse me. George. Oh. whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed.

Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after. Damn. I'm late for school. It's a board with wheels. Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. That's George McFly.

Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit.

I, I don't know. See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you. You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. Leave me alone.

Where's Einstein, is he with you? You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. Doc. You're George McFly. Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer.

Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. No, Doc. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc.

Yeah, sure, okay. When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. Right. Ahh.

Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. I think I know exactly what you mean.

Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. No, Biff, you leave her alone.

A colored mayor, that'll be the day. Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? Well, she's not doing a very good job. Ah. Whoa. Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street.

Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. What's the meaning of this.

I guarantee it. Yeah, it's 8:00. What's with the life preserver? What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age. One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott.

Hello. Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. Who? Well, Biff. C'mon, c'mon let's go.

Right. Marty, such a nice name. Huh? After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him-

Right, and where am I gonna be? What? Sit here, Marty. It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple. Oh yes sir.

Ah. We never would have fallen in love. The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. Yeah. Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair.

Alright, punk, now- What's that thing he's on? What? Where the hell are they. About 30 years, it's a nice round number.

We all make mistakes in life, children How about a ride, Mister? Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? I, I don't know. he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you.

What? Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning.

Now which one was it, Greg or Craig? Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. Yeah.

Your, your right. I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind. Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. I hope so.

Erased from existence. Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay? Marty, why are you so nervous? Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?

Wrecked? Marty, you made it. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. Huh? Who is that guy.

Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly?

And he could sleep in my room. Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. Right, gimme a Pepsi free. Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together?

Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it. Stop it. No. That's a great idea. I'd love to park.

That's right, he's gonna be mayor. Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be.

Biff. Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. What a nightmare. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. You'll find out in thirty years.

So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. Let's go. Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand.

Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? And he could sleep in my room. Let's put him in there. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?

You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. It's my dad. He's an absolute dream. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later.

Okay, but I don't know what to say. Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. This sounds pretty heavy. Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after.

What did I just say? He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. How about a ride, Mister? That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine.

Now Biff, don't con me. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. You do? I just wanna use the phone. C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety.

Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row. Does your mom know about tomorrow night? Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. I'm gonna ram him. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time.

Ah. Whoa. Who are you? Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something?

Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. Alright, take it up, go. Doc. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? Nothing's coming to my mind. Uh, coast guard.

Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids. No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. Maybe you were adopted. Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.

Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. Well, they're bigger than me.

Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? You're gonna be in the car with her. Yeah okay. Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked. Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets.

Alright, punk, now- I said the keys are in here. Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life.

After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload.

What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? C'mon. Yeah, it's 8:00. Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here?

Well, she's not doing a very good job. I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? Yeah. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay?

Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. What the hell is this? Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?

Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... George. Watch it, Goldie. Yeah. Uh?

Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. No. C'mon. Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. That's a big bruise you have there.

Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. Children. Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. What did I just say?

Yoo. Who is that guy. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it.

Let's go. Good morning, Mom. Do you mind if we park for a while? Alright, we're the pinheads. Precisely.

Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight. About how far ahead are you going? It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking. Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott.

You have this thing hooked up to the car? About 30 years, it's a nice round number. I will. Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port?

Excuse me. What, what is it hot? Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- Uncle Jailbird Joey?

George, help me, please. That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. Huh? Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda She's just trying to keep you respectable.

Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. Did you hurt your head? Marty, why are you so nervous?

No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin. Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. I think you got the wrong car, McFly. Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time?

Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. Ah well, sort of.

Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. Ahh. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear?

Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you. You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. You'll find out in thirty years.

Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow. Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine.

That's George McFly. Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. Quiet. Calvin. Ahh. Ahh.

Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? No. Oh, what I meant to day was- Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin.

Science Fiction Theater. C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. Huh? Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye.

Uh, I think so. The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. Now Biff, don't con me. Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance.

I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. Flux capacitor. No, fine, no , good, fine, good. Well, she's not doing a very good job. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner.

Oh, yeah, yeah. Marty, you made it. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine.

We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. George. Oh yes sir. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. Looks like a airplane, without wings.

Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. She's just trying to keep you respectable. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. I will.

No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing? I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. Oh. Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. Who?

Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George.

Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. Yeah well, you shouldn't drink.

Doc. Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright? Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. Why not?

Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. Maybe you were adopted. Where were we.

This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father. Doc. Why not? Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? Excuse me.

I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? Um, well it's a delorean, right? What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Hello. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything.

Aw yeah, everything is great. The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety.

Doc, she didn't even look at him. You don't understand. I guarantee it. Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. Stop it.

Where does he come from? Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row. Excuse me. Say that again. The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue?

That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. Why not? Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. Now Biff, don't con me.

George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. What did I just say? Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called.

Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. Doc, wait. No, bastards. No. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. About how far ahead are you going?

Are those my clocks I hear? Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her- I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. I think we need a rematch.

Well gee, I don't know. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother.

No, fine, no , good, fine, good. Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. You'll find out. Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day.

What, what, ma? Breakfast. Ah, where're my pants? Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? Yeah.

Um, yeah, I'm on my way. Let's go. Huh? this has gotta be a dream. Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head?

I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day? Whoa, whoa, okay. I, I don't know.

Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. Leave me alone. Stop it. I'll get it back to you, alright?

Right. Ahh. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Weight has nothing to do with it. C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil.

Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. Whoa, whoa, okay. Marty. Marty. Marty. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc.

Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. We do now. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational.

Oh. In that case, I'll tell you strait out. Well, Biff. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.

Well, this is a radiation suit. whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. Alright, punk, now- Marty, you made it. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you?

Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. Oh yes sir.

Uh, I think so. Yeah, I think maybe you do. I'm gonna ram him. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. Right, gimme a Pepsi free.

Looks like a airplane, without wings. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Ahh. It's already mutated into human form, shoot it.

Uh, coast guard. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy.

Right. That's a big bruise you have there. Scram, McFly. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope.

Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? You're George McFly. George. C'mon, c'mon let's go. Yeah.

A colored mayor, that'll be the day. Nothing's coming to my mind. No, I refuse to except the responsibility. Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her- Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature.

Right, gimme a Pepsi free. Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her. Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. That's right, he's gonna be mayor.

Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. Marty, will we ever see you again?

Which one's your pop? Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day.

Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row. Marty, why are you so nervous? You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town.

We never would have fallen in love. What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. Ah. This sounds pretty heavy. Well uh, good, fine.

Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- I think we need a rematch. George, help me, please. This is for all you lovers out there.

McFly. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Right, gimme a Pepsi free. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.

Okay. I think we need a rematch. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. Well, she's not doing a very good job. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955.

Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. I've gotta go.

No, Doc. I have to tell you about the future. You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. That's him.

Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row. Without any sugar. Why am I always the last one to know about these things. Doc. Without any sugar.

You have this thing hooked up to the car? Right. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? Good morning. What the hell is a gigawatt?

Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Stop it. Hello.

Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. Yeah. Hey boy, are you alright? So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George.

Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall?

Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. No. Where's Einstein, is he with you?

Are you gonna order something, kid? Science Fiction Theater. Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. Okay. Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till-

We never would have fallen in love. Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. I followed you. You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe.

C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. It's about the future, isn't it? Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. Yeah.

Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father. That's right, he's gonna be mayor. You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town. I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison.

Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house? What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? I will. That's George McFly? Marty you gotta come back with me.

I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. You're gonna be in the car with her. Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them.

Well, I figured, what the hell. That's him. Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday. You do? George.

Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. That's good advice, Marty. That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Who are you?

That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. It's a board with wheels. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. Ahh. Ahh.

Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? Nothing's coming to my mind. I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright? Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon.

What's that thing he's on? It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. Yeah. Oh. Oh yes sir.

I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. Right check, Doc. Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her. Who, who? No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time.

Whoa, whoa, okay. Alright, we're the pinheads. I haven't Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it. What the hell is a gigawatt?

Yeah, well history is gonna change. Save the clock tower. Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. Nothing. Stop it.

I have to tell you about the future. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next.

Oh, what I meant to day was- Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. Oh, what I meant to day was- Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? I think I know exactly what you mean.

Yeah, sure, okay. We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. I've gotta go. Jennifer. I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy.

Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after. You bet. Ohh, no. Where's Einstein, is he with you? Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum.

I, I don't know. One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. Right. What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine.

When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. Let's get him. Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. No, why, what's a matter?

What about George? Okay, but I don't know what to say. Lorraine. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans.

No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible. I have to tell you about the future. He's a peeping tom. Dad. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. It's my dad.

Next, please. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. I have a feeling too. Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you.

Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. You're George McFly. You'll find out. Excuse me. Doc.

Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it.

Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks. You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc. Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott.

That ain't no airplane, look. We do now. Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Watch it, Goldie. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history.

That ain't no airplane, look. I will. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car. Listen, Doc.

And where's my reports? Lorraine, are you up there? I, I don't know. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow.

Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave. Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after. Who's are these?

Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? Where the hell are they. Wait a minute. Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. Uh, coast guard.

Ronald Reagon. Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight. He's an absolute dream. My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive.

No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history.

Marty you gotta come back with me. Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? Will you take care of that? Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium.

Aw yeah, everything is great. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. Um, yeah, I'm on my way. No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible.

I have to tell you about the future. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed. The keys are in the trunk. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new.

Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. Uh, well, I gotta go. Science Fiction Theater. Oh. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow.

Ah. Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. What? No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun.

See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. Ahh. Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house? Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? Mom, Dad.

Bet your ass it works. Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon. Which one's your pop? Wait a minute. Oh yes sir.

Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Next, please. What, what is it hot? Why is she gonna get angry with you? This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties.

What's the meaning of this. You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show. How's your head? Did you hurt your head? A colored mayor, that'll be the day.

Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. Flux capacitor. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Crazy drunk drivers. Right.

About 30 years, it's a nice round number. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. I have to tell you about the future.

What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age. Ronald Reagon. Good morning. What? I, I don't know.

No, not yet. Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it. Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Why am I always the last one to know about these things. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you?

I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. Alright, punk, now- There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now. Hello. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here.

Holy shit. Marty, why are you so nervous? Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. Who is that guy.

Yeah. Scram, McFly. Yoo. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please.

Alright, punk, now- It's already mutated into human form, shoot it. Oh, yeah, yeah. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Keys?

Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday. I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? Just finishing up the second coat now. Holy shit.

Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. Good morning. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc He's alright.

Huh? Right. I think you got the wrong car, McFly. Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. What a nightmare.

What a nightmare. Ahh. Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh.

I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. He's an absolute dream.

You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. Huh? That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car. So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date?

Where were we. Ah, where're my pants? Jennifer. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new.

Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother? That's a great idea. I'd love to park. Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. That's right.

Mom, Dad. Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. Marty, is that you? Why not? You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc.

McFly. Do you mind if we park for a while? I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. Doc.

Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. Shit. Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. Hi.

Who's are these? Marty, will we ever see you again? Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car.

Ahh. Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her.

So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. What did your mother ever see in that kid? Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too.

The hell you doing to my car? Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. Yeah. He's alright.

So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? We do now. Just finishing up the second coat now. Mom, Dad. Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till-

What? Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? What's a rerun? I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. Just finishing up the second coat now.

Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. What the hell is this? Save the clock tower. Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind.

The keys are in the trunk. I can't play. You okay, is everything alright? Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you?

Wow, you must be rich. Yet. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here.

One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. You bet. Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon. Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head.

Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. What the hell is a gigawatt? Good morning, Mom.

You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. What did I just say? Do you mind if we park for a while? You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. You're George McFly.

Doc, she didn't even look at him. Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? Why not? I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you. You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc.

Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. Huh? Well, this is a radiation suit. Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

Mom, Dad. Now which one was it, Greg or Craig? The keys are in the trunk. Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry.

I, I don't know. Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics.

Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. Doc. Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row.

I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. What you got under here? And where's my reports? It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. Who's are these?

Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. How's your head? Who are you? Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh.

Whoa, whoa, okay. Where the hell are they. Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. Uh, Doc. Well uh, good, fine.

I have to tell you about the future. You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? Huh? No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time.

Where does he come from? Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? Stop it. Aw yeah, everything is great.

Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? Well, they're bigger than me. The keys are in the trunk. Where were we. Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown.

Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it. Where were we. Alright, I'm ready. No. I'm writing this down, this is good stuff.

That's right. Ahh. Look, you gotta listen to me. Yeah, exactly. Uh, I think so.

Who do you think, the Libyans. Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man. I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing? When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future.

Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- You're George McFly. Breakfast. Yeah, who are you?

One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Ah, where're my pants? I'm gonna ram him.

What did I just say? Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. Leave her alone, you bastard. C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. Doc, is that a de-

I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? Jesus. Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me.

Marty, you made it. Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Yeah. Marty, you made it. Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine.

Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets. That's right, he's gonna be mayor.

Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. Perfect, just perfect.

The storm. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater.

I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. Oh. Wrecked?

Right. Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. Quiet.

Marty, why are you so nervous? Marty, that was very interesting music. Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man.

That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. Marty, will we ever see you again? A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. That's George McFly. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there?

C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car.

Who's are these? Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. No, Biff, you leave her alone. Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985?

McFly. Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. This is for all you lovers out there. The keys are in the trunk.

A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. We never would have fallen in love. Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean.

Next, please. That's a big bruise you have there. Stop it. Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88.

No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- Doc.

Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. Let's go. Uncle Jailbird Joey? I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared.

Well, Biff. Yeah, he's right here. Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright? Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. I think we need a rematch.

Never? C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed.

What's that thing he's on? Get your meat hooks off of me. Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. Marty, why are you so nervous? Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955.

Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother? Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance.

Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. I guarantee it. Okay. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.

Actually, people call me Marty. Jennifer. My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. Marty, will we ever see you again? Lorenzo, where're you keys?

George, help me, please. Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. Whoa, this is heavy. This is for all you lovers out there. Biff.

You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. I can't play. Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. What?

Now Biff, don't con me. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. No, Doc. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Stop it.

Right check, Doc. You okay, is everything alright? Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo Marty. Marty. Marty. Doc?

Okay Doc, this is it. Uh, coast guard. George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. I'm writing this down, this is good stuff.

Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. You got a permit for that? Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? No, not yet.

What? Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. Flux capacitor. Working. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow.

Calvin. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. What did you sleep in your clothes again last night. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. You'll find out.

Yeah, I think maybe you do. Chuck, Chuck, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Berry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this. Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. Why do you keep following me around? What did your mother ever see in that kid?

What did your mother ever see in that kid? Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories. Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here? Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week.

Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. Yeah, where does he live? Yeah, exactly. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch.

Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. Well, uh, listen, uh, I really- Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. The future, it's where you're going? You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc.

She's just trying to keep you respectable. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Hey boy, are you alright? No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible.

Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy. Ah. Whoa. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories.

No. Thank you. In about thirty years. Right check, Doc. George: you ever think of running for class president? Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance.

Why is she gonna get angry with you? About 30 years, it's a nice round number. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- McFly. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine.

Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. The hell you doing to my car? About 30 years, it's a nice round number. Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. Ohh, no.

And where's my reports? Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum.

Ah. Lorraine. Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit.

Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. Uncle Jailbird Joey? Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks. Whoa, whoa, okay.

I can't play. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. Well, I figured, what the hell. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly.

Why am I always the last one to know about these things. Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. Ah. Whoa. Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared.

Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. What? No, I refuse to except the responsibility.

Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. Nothing's coming to my mind. Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age.

The keys are in the trunk. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. No, I refuse to except the responsibility. Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday. Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing.

Science Fiction Theater. You have this thing hooked up to the car? That's him. Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. What?

Yeah, it's 8:00. McFly. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Right, gimme a Pepsi free. Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it.

What? Hey boy, are you alright? Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. Lorenzo, where're you keys? Its good.

My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. Right, I got it. Yeah, gimme a Tab. I'll call you tonight. Don't tell me anything.

Yeah, who are you? You're gonna be in the car with her. Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. Huh?

I'll call you tonight. Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you? You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. Hi. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George.

No, why, what's a matter? A colored mayor, that'll be the day. Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. I'll get it back to you, alright? Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something.

Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? He's alright. Stop it. Thank you. In about thirty years.

Well, she's not doing a very good job. Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car. Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave.

I can't play. This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. What you got under here? Weight has nothing to do with it.

Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines.

I just wanna use the phone. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear?

Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- Go. Ah well, sort of. Um, yeah, I'm on my way.

Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. Ahh.

Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine. Watch it, Goldie. I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- He's a very strange young man.

Marty you gotta come back with me. this has gotta be a dream. When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her. Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new.

He's a peeping tom. Dad. I hope so. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. Excuse me. What did your mother ever see in that kid?

Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Huh? We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father. What, what?

Lorenzo, where're you keys? About 30 years, it's a nice round number. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Yeah, where does he live? Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space.

Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. Uh, Doc.

Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man. What? Go. Go. Oh.

Are those my clocks I hear? Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble.

Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. You'll find out in thirty years. Leave her alone, you bastard.

We never would have fallen in love. Don't say a word. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. C'mon.

Listen, Doc. What? Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her- Well, uh, listen, uh, I really-

Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Did you hurt your head? I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. Wait a minute. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood.

Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories. Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. Uh, I think so.

How about a ride, Mister? So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world.

Who are you? Thanks a lot, kid. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Wow, you must be rich. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god.

What? I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? Next, please. What?

No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. C'mon, c'mon let's go. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called.

Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Okay Doc, this is it. Uh, well, I gotta go. He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. Uh, Doc.

Oh, yeah, yeah. Ronald Reagon. Wait a minute. I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment.

You too. Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.

Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. Doc. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Let's put him in there.

Let's go. Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? this has gotta be a dream.

Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. His head's gone, it's like it's been erased. Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. Yoo.

He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. You broke it. Wow, look at him go. Yeah. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. What?

Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. Go. Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance.

Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it. No, fine, no , good, fine, good. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact.

Jennifer. Precisely. Shit. I'm gonna be at the dance. Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown.

Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire?

You know what I do in those situations? Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Oh, what I meant to day was-

Your, your right. The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? Now which one was it, Greg or Craig? Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George?

Oh yes sir. Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row. Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked. Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon.

Looks like a airplane, without wings. My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines. That's George McFly? Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it.

Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. Nothing's coming to my mind. What's with the life preserver? Oh. Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary?

Did you hurt your head? George. I think you got the wrong car, McFly. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl.

Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh. What, what, ma?

How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. Okay, but I don't know what to say. Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car.

whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. Where were we. We do now. Keys? No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time.

No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you. Hello, Jennifer. Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985.

Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. No, Biff, you leave her alone. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. Biff. Mom, is that you?

It's my dad. Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. Oh. Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. Oh.

What, what? Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Oh, yeah, yeah. What?

That's right, he's gonna be mayor. Um, well it's a delorean, right? Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Excuse me.

Yeah, it's 8:00. Where were we. Huh? Ah, where're my pants? C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety.

Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Why do you keep following me around? How about a ride, Mister? Holy shit. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here.

This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline? Oh, just a little weather experiment. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright? Yoo.

Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. Hi, Marty.

I can't play. C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. Good morning, Mom. Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date. Right about here.

What the hell is a gigawatt? I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug. Ahh.

That's right, he's gonna be mayor. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. George. And where's my reports? You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it.

Where? Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind. Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till-

Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. Uh, yeah. And where's my reports? Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something?

I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- Thanks, thanks a lot. Take care.

Yeah. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. Hello. Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you.

A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike. Oh, just a little weather experiment. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. Huh? Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown.

So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. I can't play. Lorraine. No, Doc. Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape.

Hello, Jennifer. That's for messing up my hair. Are you sure about this storm? Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet.

Right. Thanks a lot, kid. What's going on? Where have you been all week? You have this thing hooked up to the car? How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't.

Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father. Hey boy, are you alright? Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine.

I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- Take care. What? Chuck, Chuck, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Berry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this. Yeah, who are you?

Where were we. See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here.

That's a big bruise you have there. Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. What's going on? Where have you been all week? Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. Who are you?

Are those my clocks I hear? Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? That's George McFly? Ohh, no.

Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.

Yeah, I think maybe you do. Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? Alright, I'm ready. Why not? How about a ride, Mister?

Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father. It's about the future, isn't it? Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay?

It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Excuse me. Ahh. Ahh. Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. Huh?

Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Right. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.

Does your mom know about tomorrow night? There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? The flux capacitor. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn.

What did you sleep in your clothes again last night. Oh, what I meant to day was- Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury.

Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. What a nightmare. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? What Lorraine, what?

Ah, where're my pants? Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. Without any sugar. God dammit, I'm late.

That's George McFly. I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. Ohh, no. C'mon, c'mon. Lorraine.

Right. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. Yeah okay. Oh, what I meant to day was- Who, who?

Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance. Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. I think we need a rematch. What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new.

Okay Doc, this is it. Right, and where am I gonna be? Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. What Lorraine, what? Are you okay?

It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? Scram, McFly. Uh, I think so.

He's alright. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Really. Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown.

There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Take care. No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible. No, why, what's a matter? Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.

Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. Alright, punk, now- We do now. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

I'll get it back to you, alright? Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955.

Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. Precisely. Well, this is a radiation suit. I'll call you tonight.

Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch.

Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked. What, what is it hot? Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. Huh?

I can't play. Get your meat hooks off of me. Next, please. Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there?

Go. Go. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. Next, please. How's your head? I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. No, why, what's a matter? What? Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What?

Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets. He's a very strange young man. C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. He's an absolute dream. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there?

Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking. Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. Stop it. That's a great idea. I'd love to park.

Um, well it's a delorean, right? Doc, is that a de- Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. Marty, such a nice name.

Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. Stop it. Yoo. Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye.

That's for messing up my hair. Marty, why are you so nervous? Marty, are you alright? Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Science Fiction Theater.

Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? What about George? Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine.

I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. Are you gonna order something, kid? Jennifer. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that?

1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo Jesus. No, why, what's a matter? This sounds pretty heavy.

Marty, will we ever see you again? Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave. Yeah. Marty, are you alright? I hope so.

Well yeah, you know we have two of them. That's a big bruise you have there. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? Nothing. Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it.

C'mon. Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. Weight has nothing to do with it. Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.

You okay, is everything alright? We never would have fallen in love. Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Hello.

No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- C'mon. No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble.

What, I don't get what happened. Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. Right, and where am I gonna be?

Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? Huh? Okay. Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater.

My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? Yoo. Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. I've gotta go.

Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? Wrecked? Hey. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. Who do you think, the Libyans.

Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. Marty, is that you? Well, this is a radiation suit. Because, you might regret it later in life.

What? Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. Yoo. Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works.

Why not? Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. What, I don't get what happened. That's right. You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show.

Yoo. Maybe you were adopted. Marty you gotta come back with me. No. Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown.

whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. No, Doc. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something?

Calvin. Quiet. Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Marty, that was very interesting music.

Watch it, Goldie. The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social- Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Stop it.

One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. What was it, George, bird watching? That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. She's just trying to keep you respectable. No.

Well, I guess that's everything. Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you? Ah well, sort of. Jesus, you smoke too? Now which one was it, Greg or Craig?

Watch it, Goldie. You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. Hello. Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly?

Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. I haven't Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. That's right, he's gonna be mayor.

Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. That's George McFly. Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. She's just trying to keep you respectable. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post?

Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? Sit here, Marty. A colored mayor, that'll be the day. Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. I can't play.

Without any sugar. No, Biff, you leave her alone. I haven't I think we need a rematch. Marty, such a nice name.

Lorenzo, where're you keys? C'mon. Children. Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty.

Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Get your meat hooks off of me. I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George?

Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too.

I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying. Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off?

You got a permit for that? Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. Its good. We all make mistakes in life, children Children.

Why am I always the last one to know about these things. Ah, where're my pants? Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day? Precisely. I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.

Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Which one's your pop? Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? And where's my reports?

What the hell is this? Children. I guarantee it. I guarantee it. It's a board with wheels.

Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Jesus, you smoke too? Well, they're bigger than me. Bet your ass it works. And where's my reports?

Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. Well, they're bigger than me. Yeah. Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. Huh?

Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight. George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Yeah. Which one's your pop? Well gee, I don't know.

Huh? Marty, you made it. She's just trying to keep you respectable. I have to tell you about the future. No, why, what's a matter?

Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Yeah, he's right here. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids. Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry.

Hey. Alright, we're the pinheads. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- I'll call you tonight.

Marty, why are you so nervous? And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. Where were we. C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.

I, I don't know. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. The flux capacitor. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Alright, punk, now-

Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. George, help me, please. Yeah okay. God dammit, I'm late. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there?

Right. About how far ahead are you going? Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. Flux capacitor. That's right.

Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social- There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. Right check, Doc.

Lorraine. Let's put him in there. Yeah, gimme a Tab. Who's are these? What, what is it hot?

Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? That's George McFly. Yeah, sure, okay. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility.

Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her. So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? Working. Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. Well, she's not doing a very good job.

Whoa, this is heavy. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. Uh, I think so. Nothing. No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids.

Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. Where the hell are they. George. Right. Good morning, Mom.

Mom, Dad. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. Uh, I think so.

Whoa, whoa, okay. Whoa, wait, Doc. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. This is for all you lovers out there. No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids.

I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. What was it, George, bird watching? Really. Why not? I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home.

yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. No, Biff, you leave her alone. Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? Huh?

Flux capacitor. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety.

Marty, that was very interesting music. Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. What's that thing he's on? Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Are those my clocks I hear?

Why am I always the last one to know about these things. Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father. I have to tell you about the future. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Yeah.

I don't wanna see you in here again. Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. Precisely. Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her.

Right, gimme a Pepsi free. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. Wrecked? When did this happen and- Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. Doc.

Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. Who, who? Quiet. No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?

Children. Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? Uh, well, I gotta go. Holy shit. What, what, ma?

That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. Where the hell are they. No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible.

Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Don't say a word. Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you. Marty, will we ever see you again? It's already mutated into human form, shoot it.

The future, it's where you're going? Nothing's coming to my mind. Yet. I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance.

Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed. Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man.

They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow. No, Biff, you leave her alone. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home.

Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man. I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy. I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Yeah, sure, okay.

Look, you gotta listen to me. What the hell is a gigawatt? Will you take care of that? Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?

I'll get it back to you, alright? Ah, where're my pants? Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning. Yeah, I think maybe you do. You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.

That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him- You got a permit for that? That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. Will you take care of that? Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before.

Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Say that again. Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. Well gee, I don't know. Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody.

Unroll their fire. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. Oh, what I meant to day was- I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours.

And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. Damn. I'm late for school. Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her- Holy shit.

Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. Are you gonna order something, kid? Stop it. No.

It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. Yeah well, you shouldn't drink. Say that again. Looks like a airplane, without wings.

Well yeah, you know we have two of them. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? Right. Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. Maybe you were adopted.

Well yeah, you know we have two of them. Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. The flux capacitor. Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man.

Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. What? Mom, is that you? After I fell off my toilet, I drew this.

You're gonna be in the car with her. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. I hope so.

Right check, Doc. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. Damn. I'm late for school. Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong?

Who? Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Jesus, you smoke too? Uh, well, I gotta go.

I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. What's that thing he's on? you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin.

I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc You're George McFly. Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing.

Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? Oh, just a little weather experiment. Weight has nothing to do with it. Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning.

Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. We all make mistakes in life, children What? Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. That's a great idea. I'd love to park.

Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.

That ain't no airplane, look. Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? Will you take care of that? The hell you doing to my car? Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you?

Well gee, I don't know. Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post?

Doc. Hello. That's George McFly. Bet your ass it works. Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon.

You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked. Are those my clocks I hear? Is she pretty? No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity-

Why do you keep following me around? Let's get him. No, Doc. I, I don't know. Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day.

Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. Precisely. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. Well, I figured, what the hell.

Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. What? That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?

Keys? You broke it. Wow, look at him go. Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. Science Fiction Theater. Go.

That ain't no airplane, look. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing?

I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. It's my dad. Actually, people call me Marty. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later.

Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike.

Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age. Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else.

Well uh, good, fine. C'mon. I've gotta go. What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age. Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright?

Doc. Holy shit. Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories. No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. Jennifer.

No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- Oh, yeah, yeah. Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium. Alright, we're the pinheads. Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around.

Well, this is a radiation suit. Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets. Hello. You'll find out. Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out?

Go. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. What was it, George, bird watching? What? Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life.

You don't understand. Are you sure about this storm? You bet. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. Erased from existence.

Hi, Marty. Marty. Marty. Marty. Um, yeah, I'm on my way. Right about here. Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television?

Thanks a lot, kid. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Marty. Marty. Marty. The keys are in the trunk. Marty, is that you?

That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. Marty, why are you so nervous? Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.

I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. I'm gonna be at the dance.

Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. What's that thing he's on? Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Where's Einstein, is he with you? Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope.

Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. Oh yes sir. We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. Yeah. My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all.

Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here? I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. Marty you gotta come back with me. Mom, is that you?

Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. Yeah okay. Weight has nothing to do with it.

Uh? And he could sleep in my room. Ahh. Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. Uh, Doc.

Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. Okay Doc, this is it. you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin.

That's right. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine. That's him. Biff. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny.

you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. About how far ahead are you going? Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor.

Uh, yeah. I will. C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. I think I know exactly what you mean.

Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Don't say a word. That's a great idea. I'd love to park.

oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. What did your mother ever see in that kid? What, well you mean like a date? Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here? Good morning, Mom.

I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. Unroll their fire. Lorraine, are you up there? Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time.

Yet. Uh, yeah. I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you?

Doc. Ah well, sort of. C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. I'm gonna ram him. Oh yes sir.

Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody.

You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? George. George. I, I don't know.

Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line. Ah. Whoa. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. Who is that guy.

Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. Oh, just a little weather experiment. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Leave her alone, you bastard.

Yeah, it's in the back. Did you hurt your head? Huh? This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. Why am I always the last one to know about these things.

Uh, well, I gotta go. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. Good morning.

Nothing. Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. Right. C'mon, c'mon let's go. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here.

Yeah. You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother? Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? Go. Go.

Next, please. Did you hurt your head? No, why, what's a matter? Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father.

I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. Do you mind if we park for a while? Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow.

Yeah. Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. Are you gonna order something, kid? Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George?

George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? Doc, she didn't even look at him. C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Well, this is a radiation suit. Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry.

Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. What, what? Ohh, no. And where's my reports? Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till-

Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug. Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads.

Hey boy, are you alright? What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. Doc, is that a de- Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. It's my dad.

Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. Stop it. Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it. Right check, Doc.

Ah. Well, I figured, what the hell. Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. We do now.

You broke it. Wow, look at him go. Let's put him in there. Breakfast. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature.

The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? Why am I always the last one to know about these things. What did I just say? Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George?

What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks. What a nightmare. Jesus, you smoke too? Ah, where're my pants?

Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine. Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. Uh, look me up when you get there.

Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh.

Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Go. Go. Oh.

Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. Well gee, I don't know.

Huh? Marty, that was very interesting music. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her.

But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying. Let's put him in there. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. You know what I do in those situations? Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me.

No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Doc, you gotta help- Well, they're bigger than me. And where's my reports? Yeah.

Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance.

Who, who? George. George. That's right. Well uh, good, fine. Okay Doc, this is it.

Thank you. In about thirty years. Ah. Whoa. Did you hurt your head? Ah, where're my pants? Ohh, no.

Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear? Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine.

Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories. Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- Yeah, sure, okay. Hello.

Who's are these? Yeah okay. What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. Ah, honey, your first novel.

I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. I can't play.

The keys are in the trunk. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. It's already mutated into human form, shoot it.

Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything.

Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. Excuse me. Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay? Next, please. Right about here.

Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. What did you sleep in your clothes again last night. Doc. Ahh. Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum.

C'mon, c'mon let's go. You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. God dammit, I'm late. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me.

whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. Yeah, where does he live? Right. Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh?

No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing? Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Ah well, sort of. Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her-

Ahh. Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you? We do now. What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that?

Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. You do? Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post?

Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. I think I know exactly what you mean. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god.

That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? No, bastards. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. What Lorraine, what? Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope.

It's a board with wheels. You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. Thanks, thanks a lot. Ohh, no. What?

Doc. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. What you got under here? Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- What did you sleep in your clothes again last night.

Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? Go. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space.

No, why, what's a matter? I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. I can't play. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds.

Erased from existence. Hey boy, are you alright? Precisely. Thank you. In about thirty years. Yeah, where does he live?

Leave me alone. Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? Whoa, wait, Doc. Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium.

Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Yeah. How about a ride, Mister? You're gonna be in the car with her. Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans.

Mom, is that you? You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc. Yeah well, you shouldn't drink. Leave her alone, you bastard. Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds.

It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. No, I refuse to except the responsibility. What did your mother ever see in that kid?

I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. Children. Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl.

Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. Oh, just a little weather experiment. Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. I'm gonna be at the dance. Hello.

Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? It's my dad. Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. C'mon, c'mon let's go.

Hello. What did you sleep in your clothes again last night. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Sit here, Marty.

Its good. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop.

Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. I'll call you tonight. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Right. George: you ever think of running for class president?

Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. No. Mom, is that you? Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. God dammit, I'm late.

Oh. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. Doc? Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street.

Mom, is that you? Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house.

I think we need a rematch. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. You're George McFly. Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? You'll find out in thirty years.

The storm. Well, she's not doing a very good job. Why is she gonna get angry with you? Where the hell are they. Hi, Marty.

Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. No, fine, no , good, fine, good. No. Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. Right.

Just finishing up the second coat now. Did you hurt your head? Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here? Let's put him in there. Ahh.

oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. Ahh. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? I haven't Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance.

Where? You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. Take care. What, what is it hot? Uh, look me up when you get there.

Whoa, wait, Doc. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? Who are you? I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. Right, gimme a Pepsi free.

C'mon, c'mon let's go. The flux capacitor. One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. Keys? Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next.

Doc. No. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. What? C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night.

Marty, is that you? Aw yeah, everything is great. What was it, George, bird watching? Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it.

Whoa, whoa, okay. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? It's already mutated into human form, shoot it. You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955.

What the hell is this? Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. Okay, but I don't know what to say. Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that?

Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Right, gimme a Pepsi free. I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you.

Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Right.

Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. Go. Go. Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads.

I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. Oh, what I meant to day was- You do? Uh, well, I gotta go. McFly.

Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? Yeah. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed.

Oh. C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. That's a big bruise you have there. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow. Why is she gonna get angry with you?

Who are you? Ahh. Ahh. Now which one was it, Greg or Craig? David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955.

This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father. Where's Einstein, is he with you? Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? Wrecked?

Yeah. Hello, Jennifer. Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium. Well, I guess that's everything. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.

I think we need a rematch. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing? So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact.

Who, who? Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear? I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. Ahh.

Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. I have to tell you about the future. Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties.

Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? Perfect, just perfect.

Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. That's him. You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. No.

But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. Get your meat hooks off of me. Well, uh, listen, uh, I really- Ah. Whoa. You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc.

Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. We do now. Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head.

Wait a minute. Huh? No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- I'm gonna be at the dance. Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her-

Marty, that was very interesting music. I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. That's right, he's gonna be mayor. I said the keys are in here. Hello.

Uh, well, I gotta go. Excuse me. You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble.

Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. I think I know exactly what you mean. Alright, take it up, go. Doc.

Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories. Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. George, aren't you gonna kiss me? Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics.

You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town. Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. Biff. What? What?

Right. Children. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. What? Yeah, where does he live?

A colored mayor, that'll be the day. Nothing's coming to my mind. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. Yeah. Let's go.

I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. Ahh. What? I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. What's that thing he's on?

Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. Hi, Marty. Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning?

Scram, McFly. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance. C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine.

Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Back to the future. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. Yeah. 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma.

George: you ever think of running for class president? Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. C'mon. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me.

Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out?

He's an absolute dream. Well yeah, you know we have two of them. Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of-

Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? Crazy drunk drivers. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man.

What did you say? I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. What? Jesus. Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it.

Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. I'll call you tonight. I followed you. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

Ah, where're my pants? My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. No. Hey. Yeah.

That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him- Where's Einstein, is he with you? Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Oh, just a little weather experiment.

She's just trying to keep you respectable. But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying. No. When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue?

Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? Well gee, I don't know. Without any sugar. God dammit, I'm late. George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing?

Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. You'll find out. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. Right.

Take care. Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. Who do you think, the Libyans. Yeah, well history is gonna change. Ahh.

Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine. Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her- Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared.

Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. Um, yeah, I'm on my way. Lorenzo, where're you keys? The future, it's where you're going? Science Fiction Theater.

Marty, is that you? Hello. What? Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine.

Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. Stop it. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.

Where? Your, your right. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny. Where does he come from? Yeah, he's right here.

A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. I think I know exactly what you mean. Excuse me. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. I'll call you tonight.

McFly. Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. Really. Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn.

Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. Why am I always the last one to know about these things. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new.

I said the keys are in here. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next.

Say that again. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? Quiet. It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking.

In that case, I'll tell you strait out. Sit here, Marty. Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father. He's alright.

No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Really. Right. What the hell is a gigawatt? Yeah, he's right here.

Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. Marty, such a nice name. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. Doc.

I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. I followed you. Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Lorraine, are you up there?

Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here? What you got under here? What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine.

Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed. It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple. Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave. Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.

I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Yeah. I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. Right, and where am I gonna be?

Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house? Um, yeah, I'm on my way. Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear?

Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. That's George McFly? Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago.

Oh, what I meant to day was- Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? Yeah. You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him.

So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. George, aren't you gonna kiss me? Science Fiction Theater. Well yeah, you know we have two of them. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955.

My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. Next, please. Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you?

I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. Why do you keep following me around? Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating?

Well, I guess that's everything. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. That's George McFly? Doc. Don't say a word.

Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you. Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Do you mind if we park for a while?

Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. Yeah. Who's are these? That's good advice, Marty.

How about a ride, Mister? Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight. What did your mother ever see in that kid? Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared.

Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. Okay. Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa?

Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town. Chuck, Chuck, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Berry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. Crazy drunk drivers.

And he could sleep in my room. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? Precisely. Damn. I'm late for school. Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.

Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. Okay, but I don't know what to say. Doc. Hello. Sit here, Marty.

Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it. I think I know exactly what you mean. No. Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice.

What's going on? Where have you been all week? Doc, is that a de- Oh, just a little weather experiment. Why am I always the last one to know about these things. Oh.

Excuse me. Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. Your, your right. No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand?

Whoa, whoa, okay. What did I just say? God dammit, I'm late. Doc, she didn't even look at him. What?

What, what? Huh? I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. Doc. C'mon, c'mon let's go.

But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. George. Is she pretty? Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared.

Wait a minute. The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? C'mon. Excuse me. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born.

Well, I figured, what the hell. Wow, you must be rich. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. Well, Biff. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.

Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Hello, Jennifer. Just finishing up the second coat now. He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you.

George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. Right. Science Fiction Theater.

Look, you gotta listen to me. No, fine, no , good, fine, good. Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Well, I figured, what the hell. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.

Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. A colored mayor, that'll be the day. Right. Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it?

Nothing. Doc? You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. Quiet. My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines.

What you got under here? You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. Marty, are you alright? Thank you. In about thirty years. No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids.

You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. Perfect, just perfect. I will.

How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. Hello. I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. Oh. Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book.

Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Alright, we're the pinheads. Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope.

Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother? Precisely. Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload.

Um, yeah, I'm on my way. Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Um, yeah, I'm on my way.

In that case, I'll tell you strait out. Alright, we're the pinheads. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me? What?

Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing? Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. A colored mayor, that'll be the day. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home.

I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you. Why am I always the last one to know about these things. Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? McFly. You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please.

Hello, Jennifer. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Hey boy, are you alright?

You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. Doc, wait. No, bastards. He's alright. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. Working.

No, why, what's a matter? That's right. Keys? I followed you. Right.

Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. Don't say a word. Keys? Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload.

Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. Because, you might regret it later in life. About how far ahead are you going? My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload.

Biff. That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me.

Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? What, what is it hot? Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. You're gonna be in the car with her.

Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Yeah. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history.

What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. We do now. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?

Does your mom know about tomorrow night? Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. Yeah, where does he live? Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright?

I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Whoa, this is heavy. Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row. Really. I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry.

Nothing's coming to my mind. Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social- Where were we. Without any sugar.

You don't understand. Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. What you got under here? Go. Go. What, what, ma?

Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? Okay. Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him.

Just finishing up the second coat now. And he could sleep in my room. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? Ronald Reagon.

Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me? It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking. You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? You know what I do in those situations?

Who's are these? Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch.

Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? Damn. I'm late for school. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. His head's gone, it's like it's been erased. Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady.

Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. Where were we. Stop it. Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein.

Stop it. Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. I hope so. What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. That's good advice, Marty.

Um, well it's a delorean, right? I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. Ahh. What?

Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. What, I don't get what happened. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. You okay, is everything alright?

The storm. That's George McFly? Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. It's my dad. Why not?

Who? That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. That's good advice, Marty. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous.

Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind. Wrecked? Your, your right. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment.

Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. It's a board with wheels. Well gee, I don't know. That's right, he's gonna be mayor. Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going.

Oh, what I meant to day was- Wrecked? When did this happen and- What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. Oh. What was it, George, bird watching?

Get your meat hooks off of me. Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. George: you ever think of running for class president? Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. No, Biff, you leave her alone.

Oh. Without any sugar. Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. You don't understand.

But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Stop it. McFly.

Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. Yeah, sure, okay. What a nightmare. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.

Flux capacitor. No, why, what's a matter? Yeah well, you shouldn't drink. Oh, yeah, yeah. God dammit, I'm late.

You're George McFly. That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. Doc.

Well, this is a radiation suit. Right. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time.

Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. I have to tell you about the future. C'mon. Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc?

Let's go. Lorenzo, where're you keys? I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. You okay, is everything alright? Well, she's not doing a very good job.

Precisely. Well, I guess that's everything. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. Alright, punk, now- Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday-

You're George McFly. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. You too.

No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin. Now which one was it, Greg or Craig? No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. Now Biff, don't con me. And he could sleep in my room.

Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. Well gee, I don't know. You too. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy.

Ahh. Yeah, where does he live? C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. Mom, is that you?

I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- Who are you? Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? We never would have fallen in love. Marty, you made it.

Right check, Doc. Ronald Reagon. Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. Jennifer.

Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. Hey boy, are you alright? Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need.

Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight. Get your meat hooks off of me. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. Never? Yeah, where does he live?

Well, this is a radiation suit. What about George? Alright, we're the pinheads. That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need.

C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. That's George McFly. I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Where?

That's right. Perfect, just perfect. Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? About 30 years, it's a nice round number. Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works.

Mom, Dad. Children. That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. Right check, Doc.

Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. Why do you keep following me around? Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. Jesus.

What, what? So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Chuck, Chuck, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Berry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this. You're George McFly.

Uh, coast guard. I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. Just finishing up the second coat now. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium.

Yeah, sure, okay. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. Erased from existence. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you?

Where the hell are they. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? I'll call you tonight. Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley.

Marty, why are you so nervous? Take care. Thank you. In about thirty years. Never? Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called.

That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. Doc, you gotta help- I hope so. Uh, Doc. Oh.

Well, I guess that's everything. Maybe you were adopted. Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. George, help me, please.

Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Go. Go. Are those my clocks I hear? Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. It's my dad.

About 30 years, it's a nice round number. Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you? Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week.

Doc. Okay. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads.

Marty, are you alright? Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car. Uncle Jailbird Joey?

Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? Yeah, who are you? Well, I figured, what the hell. he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you.

I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. Yeah, I think maybe you do. Bet your ass it works. Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. Yeah.

Marty, is that you? Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. I, I don't know. That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date?

Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. Uh, look me up when you get there. Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah.

Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? Yeah, sure, okay. Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it. He's your brother, Mom.

I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. Okay. Right. Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. Hello.

What, what is it hot? You bet. Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. I have to tell you about the future. Where the hell are they.

I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. Hello. Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day? Marty you gotta come back with me. Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance?

Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. I'm gonna ram him. Don't tell me anything. Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too.

Uh, coast guard. Right, I got it. Who are you? Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun.

What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? What's a rerun? Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Aw yeah, everything is great. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny.

Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat.

Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Okay Doc, this is it. Doc. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. That's him.

Whoa, this is heavy. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? What Lorraine, what? I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- Chuck, Chuck, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Berry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this.

I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. Crazy drunk drivers. I, I don't know. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat.

Breakfast. Stop it. I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? Well, she's not doing a very good job.

Wrecked? Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple. Yeah, where does he live? Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you.

Oh. No, fine, no , good, fine, good. Doc, you gotta help- Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.

About how far ahead are you going? You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something.

My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines. Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. What did you say? Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance.

Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. Uh?

Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him.

Are you gonna order something, kid? He's a very strange young man. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop.

Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline? What was it, George, bird watching? No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids.

That's good advice, Marty. Who? Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. Your, your right. Oh.

Are you okay? Ah well, sort of. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. Mom, Dad. It's my dad.

Yeah, he's right here. Huh? Ahh. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. What did your mother ever see in that kid?

Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. Uh? This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline? No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin. Maybe you were adopted.

Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. Keys? oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. Marty you gotta come back with me. I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future-

Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? Uh? Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new.

I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. this has gotta be a dream. I have to tell you about the future.

Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it. That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him- Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father. Well uh, good, fine.

No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. This sounds pretty heavy. Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. Well, I figured, what the hell.

Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. Good morning, Mom. Why not? Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. Go. Go.

I have a feeling too. No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. Hey boy, are you alright?

Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. What did you sleep in your clothes again last night. Huh? Precisely.

Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny. Without any sugar. Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you. Watch it, Goldie. Lorenzo, where're you keys?

You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. I have to tell you about the future.

Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. Yeah. It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life.

Huh? Marty, that was very interesting music. Wait a minute. Yeah, who are you? Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison.

Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. Marty, are you alright? So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Well, I guess that's everything. Ahh.

I have to tell you about the future. Flux capacitor. The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. Did you hurt your head?

Aw yeah, everything is great. Excuse me. I don't wanna see you in here again. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma.

Okay. Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. Biff. That's a big bruise you have there.

Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date. This sounds pretty heavy. No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids. You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home.

Yoo. Ah well, sort of. Will you take care of that? Does your mom know about tomorrow night? Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going.

Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Oh. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. Well, Biff. Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright?

What, well you mean like a date? You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show. Without any sugar. This is for all you lovers out there. I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car.

Marty, is that you? That's him. We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. Oh. I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here.

I guarantee it. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. Oh. You know what I do in those situations? Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave.

No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Um, well it's a delorean, right? Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line. I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations.

Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Uh, Doc. Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me.

Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? Look, you gotta listen to me. I haven't This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties.

You too. Holy shit. He's a peeping tom. Dad. Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? I haven't

We do now. Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. Yeah, it's in the back. We all make mistakes in life, children The flux capacitor.

Stop it. Oh. I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? I, I don't know. Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry.

My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? About how far ahead are you going? Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh. Right, gimme a Pepsi free.

Ahh. Ahh. Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. No, not yet.

Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Weight has nothing to do with it. Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? No, fine, no , good, fine, good. When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future.

Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. Oh.

C'mon, c'mon let's go. Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. What's with the life preserver? Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. Who are you?

You know what I do in those situations? Which one's your pop? That's for messing up my hair. Really. Precisely.

I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. Calvin. I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly.

What's a rerun? I just wanna use the phone. You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. Don't tell me anything. Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head?

No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. C'mon. Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me? Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. What, what?

Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. I haven't Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book.

Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. Are you okay? This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline? Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. About how far ahead are you going?

We never would have fallen in love. Well, I guess that's everything. Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. What, well you mean like a date? Erased from existence.

He's a very strange young man. My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? George, aren't you gonna kiss me?

It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? Stop it. Calvin. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine.

Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. He's an absolute dream. You'll find out in thirty years.

He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- I followed you. What, what, ma?

Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Bet your ass it works. That's right, he's gonna be mayor. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.

Say that again. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- Wait a minute.

Aw yeah, everything is great. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. He's an absolute dream. How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. Alright, take it up, go. Doc.

I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. I just wanna use the phone. Ahh. Ahh. How about a ride, Mister? You don't understand.

I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. No. Okay Doc, this is it. I'm gonna ram him.

Marty, are you alright? Where? No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Say that again.

C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house? Right about here. Alright, I'm ready. Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair.

Stop it. That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car. We never would have fallen in love. Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday.

Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. Wait a minute. Right, and where am I gonna be? Well uh, good, fine. C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night.

I will. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. Well, uh, listen, uh, I really-

Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? Get your meat hooks off of me. That's right. Don't say a word. Does your mom know about tomorrow night?

Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. Wrecked? How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't.

Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. Precisely. Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury.

Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Nothing. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine. Biff. Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh?

No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? The hell you doing to my car? Ahh. Ahh. Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay.

I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you. Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. this has gotta be a dream.

So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? McFly.

Are you gonna order something, kid? Precisely. Well yeah, you know we have two of them. C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. Actually, people call me Marty.

Does your mom know about tomorrow night? Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? Marty, are you alright? No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- Whoa, this is heavy.

What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. Um, well it's a delorean, right? Why am I always the last one to know about these things. No, I refuse to except the responsibility.

Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? No. Go. Go. Doc. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too.

Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine.

Precisely. Will you take care of that? Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. Huh? Uh, you mean nobody's asked you?

Stop it. Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. Hey boy, are you alright? Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave. Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it?

Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. Maybe you were adopted.

Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? Stop it. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine.

Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. Take care. Maybe you were adopted. Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? That ain't no airplane, look.

Chuck, Chuck, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Berry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this. Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. Hey. C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name.

Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. I followed you. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. This is for all you lovers out there.

Bet your ass it works. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties.

Ah. Whoa. Well, uh, listen, uh, I really- Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you?

Excuse me. Yeah, it's in the back. I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. No. Okay.

oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. You don't understand. You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty.

Huh? It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. Mom, is that you? Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. What?

Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. Jesus, you smoke too? And he could sleep in my room. I followed you. Looks like a airplane, without wings.

Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks. Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. Hello. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you?

Yeah, I think maybe you do. Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you. this has gotta be a dream. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? Well, she's not doing a very good job.

Are you gonna order something, kid? And he could sleep in my room. C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl.

yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave. Are you sure about this storm? What's going on? Where have you been all week? I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.

You got a permit for that? Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now. Oh yes sir.

Biff. Hi, Marty. Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you. And where's my reports? Look, you gotta listen to me.

George: you ever think of running for class president? Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? Marty, is that you?

Children. Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day? You'll find out. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties.

Good morning. George. Listen, Doc. What did you say? What's that thing he's on?

Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. Alright, take it up, go. Doc. Breakfast. No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey.

Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. Huh? Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together?

Let's go. Ahh. Quiet. Excuse me. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine.

What, what? Yet. Maybe you were adopted. Ahh. Ahh. Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it.

Why not? George. You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her.

The hell you doing to my car? Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday. Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father. Yeah. We all make mistakes in life, children

What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. Uh, I think so. Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? Right. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time.

Ahh. No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids. Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? Doc. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here.

Ahh. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. Wrecked? Oh yes sir.

Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. You're gonna be in the car with her. Oh, just a little weather experiment. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside-

Who is that guy. What? Hello. C'mon. Well, uh, listen, uh, I really-

No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. Marty, is that you? Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life?

Oh. Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? I think we need a rematch. You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. No, Doc.

Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. No. In that case, I'll tell you strait out. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. That's him.

Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me? Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. Yeah.

Okay Doc, this is it. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Lorraine. Good morning. Where were we.

That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him- Uh, yeah. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. Doc. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.

Mom, Dad. Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book.

I don't wanna see you in here again. We all make mistakes in life, children That's right. That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. C'mon, c'mon let's go.

Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed. It's a board with wheels. Ahh. Ahh. Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing?

Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. Well, I guess that's everything. Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. Are you gonna order something, kid?

Who's are these? Who's are these? Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. What, what? What about George?

No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. What? Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. Alright, I'm ready. Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice.

Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Whoa, wait, Doc. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born.

Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. Ronald Reagon. Alright, punk, now- Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you.

he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. Hello. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985.

Okay. Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it. Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning. Okay. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one.

Well gee, I don't know. George. Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Stop it.

So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Wrecked? When did this happen and- Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? Hey. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh.

Huh? It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? Well, they're bigger than me. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later.

Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. He's your brother, Mom. Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother?

I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. No. You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties.

This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn.

Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? Who? Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? Yeah, well history is gonna change.

Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. The flux capacitor. How's your head? Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat?

Huh? Shit. Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? Ronald Reagon. Watch it, Goldie.

Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. Right. Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall?

Alright, take it up, go. Doc. Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now.

No, Doc. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. You broke it. Wow, look at him go. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? Say that again.

Well, Biff. Wrecked? Huh? Without any sugar. Oh, just a little weather experiment.

Watch it, Goldie. Excuse me. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. You got a permit for that? Thank you. In about thirty years.

Shit. Don't tell me anything. Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. About how far ahead are you going? Jesus.

Right check, Doc. Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. Where the hell are they.

Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. Why is she gonna get angry with you? Uh, I think so. Take care. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.

What? C'mon, c'mon. Um, yeah, I'm on my way. What about George? Right.

He's your brother, Mom. That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. Okay. Excuse me. Why not?

What did I just say? You know what I do in those situations? Marty, that was very interesting music. That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him- Right.

What did I just say? Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium. Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home.

I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright? George: you ever think of running for class president? Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. Hey.

George. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. Nothing.

Yeah, exactly. What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. Yeah. You too. About 30 years, it's a nice round number.

Oh. Excuse me. I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury.

Yeah, it's 8:00. Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line. What's going on? Where have you been all week? Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh. I haven't

Without any sugar. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Hey boy, are you alright? Where does he come from?

Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Yeah, sure, okay. Yeah, it's 8:00. He's your brother, Mom. Good morning.

The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. Don't tell me anything. Oh, what I meant to day was- Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you.

Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. Doc, wait. No, bastards. Hi. Excuse me. Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be.

George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? What? Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage.

Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you. How about a ride, Mister? That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. Mom, Dad. C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil.

Yeah okay. What? Weight has nothing to do with it. That's a big bruise you have there. It's already mutated into human form, shoot it.

C'mon, c'mon. That's good advice, Marty. Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Oh. Hello, Jennifer.

He's an absolute dream. Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. Marty, that was very interesting music. Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage.

Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright? That's George McFly? Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly.

Stop it. Okay. Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. That ain't no airplane, look.

I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. Go. Go. What the hell is this? Yeah, sure, okay.

Well, they're bigger than me. Look, you gotta listen to me. I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there?

I'm gonna ram him. That's right. Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day? C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. Lorraine.

Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. Leave her alone, you bastard. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. Uh? What was it, George, bird watching?

Look, you gotta listen to me. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Huh? Oh yes sir. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday-

Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. What? How's your head? Right. Uh, well, I gotta go.

Yeah, gimme a Tab. He's a very strange young man. That's right. Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. What did you sleep in your clothes again last night.

A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike. Excuse me. Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks. Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties?

What? Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. Listen, Doc. Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two.

Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. Yeah, it's 8:00. Take care. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow.

It's my dad. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? Hello. Holy shit. Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George?

Alright, I'm ready. No, fine, no , good, fine, good. Ahh. Ahh. Never mind that now, never mind that now. Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off?

Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Stop it. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?

I've gotta go. I guarantee it. He's your brother, Mom. You'll find out. Ah, honey, your first novel.

Well uh, good, fine. You have this thing hooked up to the car? Ahh. Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind. Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand.

That's a big bruise you have there. Yeah, I think maybe you do. Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here? I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. Ahh.

Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. That's George McFly? That's for messing up my hair. Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin.

What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Marty you gotta come back with me. Take care. Yeah. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly?

Leave her alone, you bastard. Okay, but I don't know what to say. Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. Stop it.

Leave me alone. Never? Thanks, thanks a lot. Whoa, this is heavy. C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo.

I'll call you tonight. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? What, I don't get what happened.

Ah. Whoa. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. I'll get it back to you, alright? I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly.

I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. He's a peeping tom. Dad. Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you.

You know what I do in those situations? That's a great idea. I'd love to park. Why do you keep following me around? McFly. Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is?

Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear? Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Doc, she didn't even look at him. Well, I figured, what the hell. Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street.

Hello. Ahh. Doc. What's a rerun? Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break.

Ah well, sort of. Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine.

Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. Right. Holy shit. I have a feeling too. Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand.

Yeah. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. This is for all you lovers out there. That ain't no airplane, look. Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope.

Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? What, I don't get what happened. No, Biff, you leave her alone. George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny.

He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind. No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible. Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. Working.

Really. What did I just say? Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. George. Whoa, whoa, okay.

Um, yeah, I'm on my way. Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked. No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. He's alright. Does your mom know about tomorrow night?

Holy shit. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine. Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? C'mon.

That's a great idea. I'd love to park. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny. Flux capacitor. We all make mistakes in life, children Stop it.

One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. Yeah, who are you? Just finishing up the second coat now. Who do you think, the Libyans.

I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. I have to tell you about the future. What's with the life preserver?

Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. This is for all you lovers out there.

It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. Jesus, you smoke too? God dammit, I'm late. See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time.

Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. Okay Doc, this is it. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life.

Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. Ah. Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you. Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here.

How about a ride, Mister? Well, I figured, what the hell. Will you take care of that? His head's gone, it's like it's been erased. Yeah okay.

Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? Well uh, good, fine. Thanks a lot, kid.

Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me? He's your brother, Mom. Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. Stop it.

Ah, honey, your first novel. George. Thanks, thanks a lot. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines.

Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now. I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you?

Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. It's a board with wheels. Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? Science Fiction Theater. Who are you?

Why is she gonna get angry with you? Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. Hello, Jennifer. You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.

It's a board with wheels. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. Yeah, I think maybe you do. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? Now Biff, don't con me.

I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. Thanks, thanks a lot. Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake. Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars. Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?

Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? And he could sleep in my room. Marty, that was very interesting music. We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where.

Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? Right. Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me.

No. Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her. I'm gonna ram him. Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean.

Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line. Ahh. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. Do you mind if we park for a while? You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please.

Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave. Yeah well, you shouldn't drink. I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy.

Jesus, you smoke too? We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? Nothing's coming to my mind. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home.

What? I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you. George. George. Actually, people call me Marty. Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book.

Yeah, exactly. George. The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social- I haven't Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?

Yeah, it's in the back. He's alright. What the hell is a gigawatt? I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life.

But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? Ahh. Thanks. Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy.

this has gotta be a dream. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. Which one's your pop? It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you.

Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. Yeah.

Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids. Ohh, no.

Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. God dammit, I'm late. Precisely. Say that again. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc?

It's a board with wheels. I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. Right. I don't wanna see you in here again. Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George?

Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? Hey boy, are you alright? Why is she gonna get angry with you? Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties?

Chuck, Chuck, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Berry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this. This is for all you lovers out there. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after.

Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. Ahh. he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you.

I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. Ah, where're my pants? Huh?

Do you mind if we park for a while? Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying. God dammit, I'm late. Look, you gotta listen to me.

What Lorraine, what? I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. Yeah. What's going on? Where have you been all week? Oh, what I meant to day was-

Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Yeah, I think maybe you do. That's him. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous.

Stop it. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow. Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Right.

Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature. Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. In that case, I'll tell you strait out. Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out?

Right. Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. Really.

What's a rerun? Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. Let's put him in there. This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?

What? Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. C'mon. Yeah, he's right here.

The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. Working. Who are you? Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. The future, it's where you're going?

What, what, ma? Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. Right. Doc, wait. No, bastards. Your, your right.

Mom, is that you? We do now. Stop it. Erased from existence. Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it.

You know what I do in those situations? You're gonna be in the car with her. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. Let's put him in there. I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it.

Doc. Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends.

Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. Don't tell me anything. Why not? It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post?

Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Yeah, gimme a Tab. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. No.

She's just trying to keep you respectable. Yeah. Wrecked? Yeah, exactly. Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets.

Uh? Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week.

Right. Well, Biff. I just wanna use the phone. Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility.

Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Marty, you made it. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. What a nightmare. That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor.

McFly. Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear? Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off?

Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Never? George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? Take care.

Now which one was it, Greg or Craig? Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. The future, it's where you're going? Marty, why are you so nervous? Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday.

George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. That's George McFly? Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall.

Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? Marty you gotta come back with me. Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody. It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. You're gonna be in the car with her.

Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Oh. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home.

No. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Will you take care of that? Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is?

You don't understand. Ahh. Ahh. Don't tell me anything. Yeah, gimme a Tab. Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him.

Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. Ah well, sort of. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life.

C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. Watch it, Goldie. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. Never?

Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. Oh, yeah, yeah. What? Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand?

Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? Because, you might regret it later in life. Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance.

Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. Hello, Jennifer. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. And he could sleep in my room. You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week.

Hi. Let's get him. Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. What Lorraine, what? Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance.

Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. Calvin. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. What's the meaning of this.

So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Doc, you gotta help- Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.

Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. Good morning, Mom. No, Biff, you leave her alone. Why not? You know what I do in those situations?

George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Why do you keep following me around?

Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. Why do you keep following me around? My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on.

What? Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe.

We do now. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father. Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you.

Because, you might regret it later in life. Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row.

Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. Right about here. I said the keys are in here.

This sounds pretty heavy. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. You'll find out. We do now.

It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple. Are you okay? There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind. C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil.

Well, I figured, what the hell. Right. Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line.

McFly. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. Because, you might regret it later in life. That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series. Well, I guess that's everything.

You know what I do in those situations? I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? Ohh, no. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked.

Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. You do? You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed.

Yeah, I think maybe you do. Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you. Marty, is that you? But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater.

Ronald Reagon. Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. Who, who? Oh.

Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. Right. Yeah, where does he live?

Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- Without any sugar. Stop it. Yeah well, you shouldn't drink. That's for messing up my hair.

My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. No, Doc.

Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. Um, yeah, I'm on my way. Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? Its good.

Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. Um, well it's a delorean, right? Doc. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you.

My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. He's a peeping tom. Dad.

There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc. This is for all you lovers out there. Ah. Whoa. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world.

What, what, ma? Calvin. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this.

Yeah. Children. God dammit, I'm late. And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you?

Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Scram, McFly. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88.

C'mon. Oh, what I meant to day was- Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.

Marty, will we ever see you again? Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay? What? Whoa, whoa, okay. The storm.

The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. Doc. You're gonna be in the car with her. Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88.

Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. Never mind that now, never mind that now. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. I'm writing this down, this is good stuff.

Yeah, I think maybe you do. Maybe you were adopted. I just wanna use the phone. That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. C'mon.

Uh, coast guard. Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand.

No. No, not yet. Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. What about George? Thanks, thanks a lot.

Where? Jesus, you smoke too? You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. Ah.

And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. C'mon, c'mon let's go. That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. Right. You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it.

You broke it. Wow, look at him go. Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. What the hell is this? C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955.

I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. Its good. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. I just wanna use the phone.

Hi. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing? There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now. Uh? Let him go, Biff, you're drunk.

Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. C'mon, c'mon. My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him.

Wrecked? She's just trying to keep you respectable. Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc?

Yeah. You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing?

Doc, she didn't even look at him. You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. Yeah well, you shouldn't drink. Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe.

Uh? Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine. Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him-

Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. Maybe you were adopted. Working. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun.

C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social- Right about here. No, bastards. Alright, punk, now-

Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me? Hey boy, are you alright? yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. What? The keys are in the trunk.

The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? Children. Whoa, this is heavy. Alright, I'm ready. Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy.

Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? You got a permit for that? C'mon, c'mon let's go. You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. I haven't

Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Why not? Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you.

Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Marty, you made it. Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn.

It's my dad. Go. Yeah, I think maybe you do. You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show. George, help me, please.

You do? I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. A colored mayor, that'll be the day. What's going on? Where have you been all week? Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen.

He's an absolute dream. I haven't Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Yeah. C'mon, c'mon.

Huh? Marty, are you alright? Excuse me. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. What, I don't get what happened.

Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? That's George McFly? Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.

Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. Let's go. You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one.

I guarantee it. Quiet. Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. Holy shit.

Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight. Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? I think you got the wrong car, McFly. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. How about a ride, Mister?

Yeah, where does he live? That's George McFly. Crazy drunk drivers. C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life.

This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father. Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Back to the future. Nothing's coming to my mind. Leave her alone, you bastard.

George. George. Back to the future. Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? Oh. Perfect, just perfect.

That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? Right, gimme a Pepsi free. Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?

Back to the future. Perfect, just perfect. Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. How about a ride, Mister? Weight has nothing to do with it.

Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? Right, gimme a Pepsi free. Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance.

Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- this has gotta be a dream. There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now. Huh? That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid.

Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. Yeah. Don't say a word. Breakfast. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.

Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? Erased from existence. Back to the future. Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked.

Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. What? Wow, you must be rich.

I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? Listen, Doc. Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man. C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. Holy shit.

Ahh. It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc

Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. What did you say? Bet your ass it works. Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name.

Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row. This is for all you lovers out there. Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. Never? I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet.

this has gotta be a dream. So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? That's George McFly? Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? Actually, people call me Marty.

I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. Are you okay? Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her.

Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? Let's put him in there. Precisely. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. Right.

You don't understand. I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload.

Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. Yeah okay. Uncle Jailbird Joey?

This is for all you lovers out there. Quiet. Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. Yeah. He's a peeping tom. Dad.

So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. We all make mistakes in life, children No, fine, no , good, fine, good. Erased from existence. George: you ever think of running for class president?

Never mind that now, never mind that now. What, what is it hot? Right. I'm gonna be at the dance. Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein.

Who is that guy. Just finishing up the second coat now. Ahh. Ahh. Lorraine. Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear?

Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny. Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. George. Marty, such a nice name. His head's gone, it's like it's been erased.

Ahh. Ahh. You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. Uh, yeah. It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking. What the hell is this?

Why am I always the last one to know about these things. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it.

Who's are these? Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. What? Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Oh, yeah, yeah.

Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike. What's a rerun? Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? Well gee, I don't know.

Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? I think we need a rematch. Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her- So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port?

The hell you doing to my car? you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. Say that again. Let's put him in there. It's my dad.

What? Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh. Whoa, whoa, okay.

Lorenzo, where're you keys? I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight. The future, it's where you're going?

Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. You're gonna be in the car with her. Lorenzo, where're you keys? No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?

Excuse me. I have a feeling too. Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? Leave her alone, you bastard. God dammit, I'm late.

Right, I got it. No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible. Thank you. In about thirty years. I think we need a rematch. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly?

I think you got the wrong car, McFly. That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. It's already mutated into human form, shoot it. Because, you might regret it later in life.

I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. Whoa, this is heavy. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else.

Well, Biff. Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. Yeah. Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new.

I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. What? Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble.

Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking. Right check, Doc. Ah.

Nothing's coming to my mind. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. How about a ride, Mister? Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born.

Jesus, you smoke too? Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. Perfect, just perfect. Yeah, I think maybe you do.

Ah, honey, your first novel. Let's get him. It's my dad. Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc

Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. Right. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? Hi.

Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo You too.

Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. Where were we. Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week.

What did your mother ever see in that kid? Precisely. Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. Hi.

I, I don't know. Sit here, Marty. What, what, ma? Who, who? Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be.

Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. Whoa, whoa, okay. Take care. Lorraine, are you up there? You bet.

Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed. Right. My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. He's alright. Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight.

Marty, will we ever see you again? Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium. Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? Perfect, just perfect.

That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car. I think I know exactly what you mean. You bet. Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon.

I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Yeah. How about a ride, Mister? Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? Actually, people call me Marty.

Huh? Doc, is that a de- Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. Who are you? Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer.

Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked. What's the meaning of this. Why is she gonna get angry with you? Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin.

Now Biff, don't con me. Right. His head's gone, it's like it's been erased. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. Oh yes sir.

Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Did you hurt your head? Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. Um, well it's a delorean, right?

Uh, look me up when you get there. Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. Doc. No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin. You're George McFly.

Hello. What, what is it hot? Leave her alone, you bastard. What a nightmare. Is she pretty?

Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo Listen, Doc. I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. Go. Go. C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety.

How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. That's George McFly? Hello, Jennifer. Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me?

Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. The future, it's where you're going? Uncle Jailbird Joey? Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor.

It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking. I have a feeling too. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. What a nightmare.

Is she pretty? Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. Who are you?

What was it, George, bird watching? Yeah. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? How about a ride, Mister? Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall.

Looks like a airplane, without wings. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. Marty, is that you? How's your head? Um, yeah, I'm on my way.

Right. Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. Erased from existence.

Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. Yeah. Next, please.

I'll call you tonight. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. Right. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date?

Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row. What did you sleep in your clothes again last night. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? Uh, you mean nobody's asked you?

Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. Excuse me. Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy.

Okay. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. Who are you? No. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly?

Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. Lorraine, are you up there? Don't say a word. Well, Biff.

This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. Breakfast. Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date. This is for all you lovers out there. Ahh.

Unroll their fire. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show. You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks.

I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy. C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. Okay Doc, this is it.

Yeah, it's in the back. He's a peeping tom. Dad. Next, please. Watch it, Goldie. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday-

Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. Never mind that now, never mind that now. Unroll their fire. Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you. No, fine, no , good, fine, good.

Whoa, whoa, okay. I have to tell you about the future. Right. You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. Keys?

Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. What, I don't get what happened. Go. This is for all you lovers out there. Hello.

Don't say a word. Who is that guy. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc.

My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. Yeah, gimme a Tab. How about a ride, Mister? Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.

Uh, look me up when you get there. Perfect, just perfect. What's with the life preserver? Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon.

Wow, you must be rich. He's alright. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. Alright, we're the pinheads. Let's put him in there.

Sit here, Marty. I can't play. C'mon, c'mon. Marty. Marty. Marty. That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream.

Lorraine. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan.

What? Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon. Well, Biff. Yeah, exactly.

Ah. Whoa. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Damn. I'm late for school. Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. Never mind that now, never mind that now.

Okay. No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. Doc. Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun.

This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father. That's him. Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc Leave her alone, you bastard.

Who? The flux capacitor. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out?

Who are you? Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. Hi, Marty. Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88.

Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. We never would have fallen in love. That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. Say that again.

Thanks a lot, kid. Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line. I have to tell you about the future. Don't tell me anything. Hello.

Next, please. Yeah. whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. It's a board with wheels.

My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you?

Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. Go. 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents.

Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind. Right about here. We never would have fallen in love. Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you.

My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. Okay. What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. You bet. Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father.

Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Precisely. I can't play.

Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you. Oh, yeah, yeah. No, bastards. Yeah. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.

Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. What's a rerun? I have a feeling too. Yeah, well history is gonna change. No.

And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. Okay. Thanks, thanks a lot. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post?

Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. Scram, McFly. Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. Shit. Who are you?

Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning. No, fine, no , good, fine, good. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance.

Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Thanks. Who is that guy. That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him- Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun.

Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. Uh, well, I gotta go.

Oh, just a little weather experiment. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Why do you keep following me around? Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday. Maybe you were adopted.

Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo Ronald Reagon. C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. How about a ride, Mister? Why do you keep following me around?

Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? That's for messing up my hair. What? Hey, hey, Doc, where are you?

Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. That's right, he's gonna be mayor. Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. Ah, honey, your first novel.

But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying. Without any sugar. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. Where's Einstein, is he with you? No, I refuse to except the responsibility.

Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Oh. Yeah, it's 8:00. It's already mutated into human form, shoot it. Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets.

whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? Doc? Without any sugar. Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it?

Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? Jesus, you smoke too? Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon.

Never mind that now, never mind that now. What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... Where's Einstein, is he with you? Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown.

Ahh. Ahh. I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Actually, people call me Marty. Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug.

Holy shit. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. Yeah, it's in the back. Biff. What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine.

C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner.

Nothing. I think you got the wrong car, McFly. George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Huh? Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off?

Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. What did your mother ever see in that kid? What? Really. C'mon, c'mon.

Marty, will we ever see you again? There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now. Well, Biff. What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. Yeah, where does he live?

Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. What did you say? Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Hello, Jennifer.

I think we need a rematch. No, fine, no , good, fine, good. That's a great idea. I'd love to park. Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her.

Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me? I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? Marty, you made it. Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong?

Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. Hi, Marty. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? He's a very strange young man.

Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? We never would have fallen in love.

Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something?

How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. The keys are in the trunk. Lorraine. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What?

Lorenzo, where're you keys? What did you sleep in your clothes again last night. That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. C'mon.

Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? What's with the life preserver? Jesus, you smoke too? Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. Ah.

Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. Without any sugar. Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her-

Erased from existence. Children. Okay Doc, this is it. Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you?

What, I don't get what happened. Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny. What did you say? Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?

Right, I got it. Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all.

C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. That's George McFly. Keys? Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. Right.

Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? Well, I figured, what the hell. Yeah, it's in the back. I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations.

What a nightmare. Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? Biff. Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay?

he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. Jesus, you smoke too? C'mon. Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him.

You got a permit for that? You're gonna be in the car with her. Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. No.

Yeah, it's 8:00. Yeah. Maybe you were adopted. Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? Who are you?

Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine. I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy. Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown.

Go. Go. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. Huh? That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. Um, yeah, I'm on my way.

In that case, I'll tell you strait out. Where the hell are they. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked.

Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. It's already mutated into human form, shoot it. What did you say? What the hell is a gigawatt?

Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. Um, well it's a delorean, right? Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.

Oh. Alright, we're the pinheads. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. God dammit, I'm late. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you?

Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. What did I just say? Marty, such a nice name. What Lorraine, what?

Oh. Jennifer. Okay. George, help me, please. Huh?

C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- Nothing's coming to my mind. Oh. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous.

I don't wanna see you in here again. Why am I always the last one to know about these things. One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- Right.

He's an absolute dream. Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... Don't say a word. Excuse me. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday-

Let's go. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- What about George? Uh, look me up when you get there.

oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. Uh, look me up when you get there. What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. Hello. I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?

Excuse me. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. Why am I always the last one to know about these things. What?

Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright? You know what I do in those situations? One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines.

Right, gimme a Pepsi free. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. Oh. Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you.

Marty, why are you so nervous? Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. Right, and where am I gonna be? Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her.

I'll call you tonight. It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking. Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- Well, she's not doing a very good job.

I have to tell you about the future. Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. George. Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. Nothing.

I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- This sounds pretty heavy. How about a ride, Mister? Keys? Because, you might regret it later in life.

So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. Leave me alone. Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. Doc, wait. No, bastards.

Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. You do? Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop.

Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying. Hey. But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying. Well gee, I don't know.

This is for all you lovers out there. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. Ohh, no. Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line.

That's for messing up my hair. My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. Lorraine. Don't say a word. I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.

Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? Scram, McFly. Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. Don't say a word. this has gotta be a dream.

Will you take care of that? Jesus. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. I have to tell you about the future. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive.

What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- Nothing's coming to my mind. whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world.

What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Holy shit. Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc?

Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? Well, Biff. Are those my clocks I hear? Look, you gotta listen to me. Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please.

Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... Crazy drunk drivers. No. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. He's alright.

I have to tell you about the future. Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. Marty, will we ever see you again?

Actually, people call me Marty. What? Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. What was it, George, bird watching?

Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Unroll their fire. Right about here. Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. Whoa, whoa, okay.

Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. Save the clock tower. Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. Huh?

Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Scram, McFly. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa?

Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? Maybe you were adopted. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas...

Ah, honey, your first novel. Yeah, it's in the back. Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake. Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars. I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet.

Ah, where're my pants? Aw yeah, everything is great. The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social- His head's gone, it's like it's been erased. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit.

Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. Mom, Dad. Lorenzo, where're you keys? Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. We all make mistakes in life, children

You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. It's already mutated into human form, shoot it. Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind. Who? Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born.

Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? What's the meaning of this. What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. Does your mom know about tomorrow night?

Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father. Marty you gotta come back with me. Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin.

Perfect, just perfect. Marty, you made it. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- Who is that guy. Uh, well, I gotta go.

No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay? Holy shit. What Lorraine, what? Yeah well, you shouldn't drink.

Unroll their fire. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Watch it, Goldie. Unroll their fire. Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television?

you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. I think I know exactly what you mean. Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. Who, who? I think we need a rematch.

Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? Marty, are you alright? George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it?

Yeah, well history is gonna change. I'm gonna ram him. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. Whoa, whoa, okay. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor.

Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? That's for messing up my hair. Good morning, Mom. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow.

Wait a minute. No. Is she pretty? It's my dad. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.

I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy.

Yeah well, you shouldn't drink. What? Lorraine. And he could sleep in my room. You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you.

Next, please. McFly. The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? Listen, Doc. Chuck, Chuck, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Berry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this.

Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning. You too. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Sit here, Marty. Hi.

Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. What? His head's gone, it's like it's been erased. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed.

Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. Well gee, I don't know. You broke it. Wow, look at him go.

That's George McFly. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me.

Right. Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.

Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- Yeah okay. Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind. It's about the future, isn't it? You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home.

Don't say a word. Uh, look me up when you get there. I don't wanna see you in here again. You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl.

Let's get him. That ain't no airplane, look. Are you gonna order something, kid? Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? Uh?

Oh. Wait a minute. That's George McFly? Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? That ain't no airplane, look.

I have to tell you about the future. We never would have fallen in love. I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. What?

Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. Who's are these? Marty, why are you so nervous? Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? C'mon, c'mon.

Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you. Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda Why is she gonna get angry with you? Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. Oh, just a little weather experiment.

The storm. Uh, coast guard. Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts.

Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Oh. What's that thing he's on? What's with the life preserver?

Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. What's a rerun? My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. Stop it. Jesus.

I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. Well, I guess that's everything. Does your mom know about tomorrow night? You know what I do in those situations?

Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. Yeah. Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it.

You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town. Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? What? I guarantee it.

What's going on? Where have you been all week? Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. Ah.

Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me? Hey boy, are you alright? Right. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. Well gee, I don't know.

Excuse me. Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh.

whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you.

Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. I've gotta go. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Holy shit. Shit.

he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. Uh? Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. About how far ahead are you going? Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets.

What, what? Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. That's George McFly? I don't wanna see you in here again. Alright, we're the pinheads.

Now Biff, don't con me. Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. You got a permit for that? Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works.

Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Yoo. Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown.

Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody. Just finishing up the second coat now.

Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. Are you sure about this storm? Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line. Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright?

Save the clock tower. Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? What's going on? Where have you been all week? Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Right, I got it.

Ahh. Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. Where's Einstein, is he with you? That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor.

What did you say? Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you.

Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. Are those my clocks I hear? whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. The future, it's where you're going? Really.

Doc, wait. No, bastards. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. Marty, are you alright?

Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. Leave her alone, you bastard.

I don't wanna see you in here again. Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. You're George McFly. Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.

Holy shit. Thank you. In about thirty years. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor.

You don't understand. What? That's George McFly? Why do you keep following me around? His head's gone, it's like it's been erased.

Sit here, Marty. Oh, yeah, yeah. Are you sure about this storm? You'll find out in thirty years. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god.

Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house? David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. I hope so. You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. What about George?

Chuck, Chuck, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Berry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this. That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? Marty, that was very interesting music.

Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line. I said the keys are in here. No. Yeah okay.

Right. Yeah, exactly. Who, who? Well, they're bigger than me. Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope.

Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright? Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. Look, you gotta listen to me. Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here?

I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. Marty, you made it. I think you got the wrong car, McFly. Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. No, fine, no , good, fine, good.

What's a rerun? Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? Oh.

Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Well gee, I don't know. See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. Thank you. In about thirty years. Right, I got it.

We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Biff. Oh, what I meant to day was- I can't play.

I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. That ain't no airplane, look. Well, I figured, what the hell. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple.

Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after. Are those my clocks I hear? Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? Let's get him.

What did you say? Yeah. Yeah, well history is gonna change. Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight. Looks like a airplane, without wings.

Oh. Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. What, what? Without any sugar. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational.

Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it. Hello. Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright? you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything.

Precisely. Oh, yeah, yeah. Mom, Dad. Listen, Doc. Did you hurt your head?

That's right, he's gonna be mayor. Why am I always the last one to know about these things. Why is she gonna get angry with you? Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay.

Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. Yeah. You do? Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. It's a board with wheels.

You too. Watch it, Goldie. Let's go. That's for messing up my hair. Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen.

Okay. That's good advice, Marty. No, not yet. Right about here. Uh, yeah.

So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you?

Go. Go. Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. What? I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head.

I'm gonna ram him. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? Oh, yeah, yeah. Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47.

I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy. Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father. Because, you might regret it later in life. Stop it. this has gotta be a dream.

Marty, is that you? Ahh. I don't wanna see you in here again. He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. Huh?

Ah. Oh. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? You know what I do in those situations?

Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. Get your meat hooks off of me. What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. Shit.

Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- I'll get it back to you, alright? I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.

Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? We never would have fallen in love.

Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. Doc, you gotta help- Hello, Jennifer. One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. Doc, you gotta help-

Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. C'mon, c'mon. Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug. Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear?

Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. This sounds pretty heavy.

Uh? Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. No, I refuse to except the responsibility.

Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying. Who are you? C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. Because, you might regret it later in life.

God dammit, I'm late. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. Stop it. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc.

Oh, what I meant to day was- Doc? Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc.

So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Yeah. Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? C'mon. Hello.

Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. George, aren't you gonna kiss me? There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?

There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now. He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. Working. No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy.

Stop it. Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature. Uh, coast guard. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Alright, take it up, go. Doc.

Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? Without any sugar. No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. Will you take care of that? I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours.

Oh yes sir. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. Biff. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. What?

Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. God dammit, I'm late. I guarantee it. Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home.

Oh yes sir. That's a big bruise you have there. Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. No, not yet.

What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Look, you gotta listen to me. Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985?

Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. Now which one was it, Greg or Craig? How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa?

There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. Ahh. How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't.

No. Oh, yeah, yeah. Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Are you sure about this storm? What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else.

Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. Good morning. Well, uh, listen, uh, I really- Uh?

This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father. What's going on? Where have you been all week? Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? Excuse me.

Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Now Biff, don't con me. Oh yes sir. Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. Oh.

Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. No, not yet. Ahh. Oh. Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row.

What? I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. Actually, people call me Marty. Are those my clocks I hear? It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous.

Yeah. Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind. Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear? Never mind that now, never mind that now. this has gotta be a dream.

Now Biff, don't con me. Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? Hello.

Scram, McFly. That's George McFly? What? It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood.

I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. Jesus.

You okay, is everything alright? That ain't no airplane, look. Doc. Huh? Jesus, you smoke too?

Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me.

I followed you. Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. Erased from existence. No, Doc. Ah. Whoa.

Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day. What did you say? Um, well it's a delorean, right? That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? Yeah.

Uncle Jailbird Joey? Okay Doc, this is it. Doc. Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright? No.

This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. That's him. What? No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you.

You do? Ohh, no. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow.

Yeah. What's a rerun? Well, this is a radiation suit. Precisely. Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver.

Nothing. Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father. I'm gonna be at the dance. Right check, Doc.

Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? Marty, why are you so nervous? Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. Leave me alone.

Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. I guarantee it.

Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? Never mind that now, never mind that now. Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you. Quiet. Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance.

Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? In that case, I'll tell you strait out. Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Ahh.

Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible. Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. Say that again. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine.

Yeah, gimme a Tab. And where's my reports? Ah. Whoa. Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. I've gotta go.

Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo Thanks, thanks a lot. I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. Yeah well, you shouldn't drink. Alright, we're the pinheads.

Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series. That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid.

Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. Ahh. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? Oh. You don't understand.

Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. Where's Einstein, is he with you? Doc, is that a de- What the hell is a gigawatt? Stop it.

Alright, take it up, go. Doc. Jesus. Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. Right check, Doc. Yeah.

I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. Uh, yeah. Ah. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that.

Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. He's alright. Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? His head's gone, it's like it's been erased.

Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? Looks like a airplane, without wings. Will you take care of that? Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date. Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat.

Right. C'mon. Uh? The storm. Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television.

The future, it's where you're going? Is she pretty? Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. No, fine, no , good, fine, good.

Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Right about here. The future, it's where you're going? The hell you doing to my car? I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat.

Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. She's just trying to keep you respectable. Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside-

Ahh. C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. Actually, people call me Marty. He's your brother, Mom. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later.

Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George.

His head's gone, it's like it's been erased. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. Shit. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy.

Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. Whoa, wait, Doc. It's already mutated into human form, shoot it. George.

Why am I always the last one to know about these things. Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. Save the clock tower. You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please.

Who is that guy. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. I, I don't know. What the hell is a gigawatt? Get your meat hooks off of me.

That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. C'mon, c'mon. No, bastards. Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? I will.

whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. What, what? What's with the life preserver? Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. No, fine, no , good, fine, good.

he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. What, what is it hot? Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon.

Yeah okay. Never mind that now, never mind that now. Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you. You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy.

Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine. Ahh. Ahh. You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. Huh? Ah. Whoa.

That's good advice, Marty. Yeah, it's 8:00. Holy shit. Stop it. You don't understand.

You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show. And he could sleep in my room. Well yeah, you know we have two of them. Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas.

Right. What, what? Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name.

I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance.

Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. Thank you. In about thirty years. this has gotta be a dream.

Are you sure about this storm? Go. Go. Now Biff, don't con me. There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now. Leave me alone.

Hello. Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. What did you sleep in your clothes again last night.

Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight. Marty. Marty. Marty. Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row. Well uh, good, fine.

Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Yeah, I think maybe you do. Marty, that was very interesting music. It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.

No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin. Ah. Whoa. Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you. Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new.

You know what I do in those situations? Doc. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. No, fine, no , good, fine, good.

What, what, ma? Oh. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. What did you sleep in your clothes again last night.

Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house? Oh.

Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. Um, well it's a delorean, right? Thanks, thanks a lot. Excuse me.

Yeah okay. Well, they're bigger than me. What? Right, gimme a Pepsi free. What?

Precisely. Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. Well, I guess that's everything. I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here.

Whoa, whoa, okay. Wrecked? When did this happen and- It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. Leave me alone. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home.

It's a board with wheels. Which one's your pop? Why not? Right, and where am I gonna be? We never would have fallen in love.

Where the hell are they. Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. Biff. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. Right.

Right. Uh? Excuse me. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat.

What Lorraine, what? He's your brother, Mom. Um, well it's a delorean, right? What's going on? Where have you been all week? Marty, is that you?

Who's are these? No. What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Marty, you made it.

Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Right. Don't tell me anything. You'll find out. Okay Doc, this is it.

Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug. Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. Oh, yeah, yeah. Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas...

Because, you might regret it later in life. Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? Hey boy, are you alright? Yeah. What?

Huh? Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked. I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown.

No, Biff, you leave her alone. Never mind that now, never mind that now. Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. I think I know exactly what you mean.

Who are you? He's an absolute dream. Scram, McFly. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan.

Doc, is that a de- It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave. Uh, I think so.

I'm gonna ram him. C'mon, c'mon. I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. Uh, you mean nobody's asked you?

Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Yoo. Holy shit. What a nightmare. You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town.

You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you?

Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. George, aren't you gonna kiss me? Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father. You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around.

Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it. I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. What?

Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? Okay, but I don't know what to say. Hello, Jennifer. Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin?

Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Shit. Doc. Yeah.

whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? Excuse me. God dammit, I'm late. It's about the future, isn't it?

Breakfast. Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly?

I think we need a rematch. When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. What was it, George, bird watching? He's alright.

No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing? You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show. The future, it's where you're going? Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here? Never?

That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series. She's just trying to keep you respectable. My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. Okay. What?

You broke it. Wow, look at him go. Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? Your, your right. Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories. Where does he come from?

No. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines. When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car.

I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. You'll find out in thirty years. Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. What? Doc, is that a de-

Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying. Let's get him. 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed.

Yeah. Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. Huh? What the hell is this? You got a permit for that?

Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked. C'mon, c'mon let's go. I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine.

The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon. Marty, you made it. Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? Here you go, lady. There's a quarter.

What a nightmare. Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. Um, well it's a delorean, right? Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around.

Marty, are you alright? Huh? Don't say a word. George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? That's George McFly.

It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple. This is for all you lovers out there. Why not? C'mon, c'mon let's go. Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before.

Are you sure about this storm? Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Nothing. Doc. What, what, ma?

Yeah, where does he live? So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Looks like a airplane, without wings. Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after. Hi, Marty.

You bet. Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake. Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars. Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. She's just trying to keep you respectable. George.

What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. Thanks. Why do you keep following me around? Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. What's with the life preserver?

Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh. Quiet. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. No, bastards.

I followed you. Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. Will you take care of that? Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something.

Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. Alright, I'm ready. Precisely. Oh, just a little weather experiment. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this.

George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. Right check, Doc. Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright?

Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... Yeah, where does he live? After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Oh yes sir.

I just wanna use the phone. Well, they're bigger than me. Lorraine, are you up there? Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. Well, I guess that's everything.

I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. That's George McFly. What?

Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- I don't wanna see you in here again. Huh? Mom, Dad. Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is?

You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. Leave her alone, you bastard. How about a ride, Mister?

Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. What did you sleep in your clothes again last night. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc

My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. Right.

Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. Jesus, you smoke too? Is she pretty? Working. Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay?

Doc, you gotta help- 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. Save the clock tower. What you got under here? Why do you keep following me around?

You broke it. Wow, look at him go. Excuse me. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids. Hey.

Um, yeah, I'm on my way. Who, who? You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. Oh, yeah, yeah. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you?

Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Next, please. Good morning. Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.

Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. It's already mutated into human form, shoot it.

Uh? Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed. Just finishing up the second coat now. And where's my reports?

Calvin. Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Never? Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit.

Lorraine. He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. Hello. You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc. Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life?

Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Marty you gotta come back with me.

Is she pretty? Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you. he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. Uh, coast guard. I'll call you tonight.

Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. I guarantee it. Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment.

C'mon, c'mon. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. Weight has nothing to do with it. Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh. What you got under here?

What, well you mean like a date? Wait a minute. Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. She's just trying to keep you respectable. Yeah, gimme a Tab.

God dammit, I'm late. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. Um, well it's a delorean, right? Marty. Marty. Marty.

Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind. I said the keys are in here. Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her. This is for all you lovers out there. Huh?

Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? Excuse me. Yeah, exactly.

I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? Never? What's that thing he's on?

Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. I will. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. Oh, yeah, yeah.

Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody. Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? Oh. He's your brother, Mom. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post?

About how far ahead are you going? Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. The future, it's where you're going? Ah, where're my pants? I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future-

What? Whoa, this is heavy. Stop it. Right. Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo

Marty, are you alright? I said the keys are in here. Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born.

Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Who are you? I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense.

What about George? Right about here. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. Huh? Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984.

I've gotta go. Um, yeah, I'm on my way. I don't wanna see you in here again. Excuse me. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive.

What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Doc. Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Why do you keep following me around?

You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. Shit. Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids.

Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Ah. Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Marty, that was very interesting music. Let him go, Biff, you're drunk.

Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. I have a feeling too. He's your brother, Mom. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor.

Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. Look, you gotta listen to me. Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home.

Children. Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. Yeah.

They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow. What, well you mean like a date? I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Doc.

Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. Well uh, good, fine. Maybe you were adopted. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Ohh, no.

Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future.

Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? What? Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. Yet.

Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life.

Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you. That's good advice, Marty. Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born.

George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. Children. No. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday-

Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. Doc, wait. No, bastards. You'll find out. When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying.

Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. How's your head?

Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. I think you got the wrong car, McFly.

Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you. Well, uh, listen, uh, I really- No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. Whoa, whoa, okay. That's a great idea. I'd love to park.

Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda Just finishing up the second coat now. You got a permit for that? That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream.

Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. Why not? Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. You broke it. Wow, look at him go. Do you mind if we park for a while?

He's a very strange young man. Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? Who do you think, the Libyans.

Stop it. Are you sure about this storm? Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time.

Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. No.

That's a great idea. I'd love to park. Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it. You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. Good morning, Mom.

Hello. I have to tell you about the future. Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- Alright, we're the pinheads. Ahh.

Marty, that was very interesting music. Save the clock tower. Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. Yeah.

It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. Marty, will we ever see you again? Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind-

Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear? I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. Go. Go. See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. Huh?

Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. Um, well it's a delorean, right? You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. Alright, we're the pinheads. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car.

Holy shit. Lorraine, are you up there? Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. Children. No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun.

Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you? Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. We do now.

Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. Who do you think, the Libyans. he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. George. George. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing?

Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- Uh, I think so. Whoa, whoa, okay. he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin.

Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? You too. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? Save the clock tower. Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47.

Yeah, it's in the back. It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? He's your brother, Mom. What's with the life preserver?

You too. You're George McFly. Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. I guarantee it.

Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. Let's get him. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Yeah, where does he live?

Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. No. Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house? Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?

Ahh. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- I'm gonna be at the dance. Don't say a word. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George.

Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine. this has gotta be a dream. Whoa, whoa, okay. Where? My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?

No, bastards. Ah, where're my pants? Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?

Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium. C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. Doc? Alright, take it up, go. Doc. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?

Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Oh. Right, gimme a Pepsi free. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Are you okay?

That's a big bruise you have there. Marty, will we ever see you again? Um, well it's a delorean, right? Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here?

The keys are in the trunk. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. This sounds pretty heavy. Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. Yeah.

Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. Yeah, it's in the back. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Excuse me.

The storm. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Why is she gonna get angry with you? You have this thing hooked up to the car? You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother?

How about a ride, Mister? Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Why not? Whoa, this is heavy.

You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. Leave her alone, you bastard. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new.

Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. I think I know exactly what you mean. Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire?

he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. You'll find out in thirty years. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? Do you mind if we park for a while?

Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. Oh, what I meant to day was- I've gotta go.

It's about the future, isn't it? Oh, what I meant to day was- Oh, what I meant to day was- C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother.

Jesus. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. Uh, well, I gotta go. Uncle Jailbird Joey? Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean.

See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. Huh? Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. What? I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it.

Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. I followed you. He's your brother, Mom.

Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Let's get him. Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Maybe you were adopted.

Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her. Why do you keep following me around? Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. I have a feeling too. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance.

Precisely. My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines. Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets. Lorenzo, where're you keys? Alright, take it up, go. Doc.

Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- Go. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. Are you okay? Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked.

Hello, Jennifer. Excuse me. He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. Really. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive.

I hope so. Say that again. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Flux capacitor. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.

Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you. Hi, Marty. Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay? Yeah.

Doc. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. Doc. Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight.

A colored mayor, that'll be the day. You're gonna be in the car with her. Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? Marty, you made it.

Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- What? I have a feeling too. Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? No.

Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? Right. Right, and where am I gonna be? No, Doc. You'll find out.

Go. Yeah. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. I haven't

What, I don't get what happened. Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be.

Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat.

Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Leave her alone, you bastard. Good morning. Uh? Weight has nothing to do with it.

Right. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. Calvin. He's a very strange young man. Why not?

Hey boy, are you alright? Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? He's a peeping tom. Dad. Yet. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything.

Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man. Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Take care. The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. I think you got the wrong car, McFly.

Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. I haven't Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something?

Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. What? Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads.

You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright? The storm. Who? I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later.

Doc, is that a de- In that case, I'll tell you strait out. Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe.

Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance. Why not?

What? Yeah. Will you take care of that? What, what is it hot? We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where.

Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house? C'mon. Right, and where am I gonna be? Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- Bet your ass it works.

Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. Really. Doc.

Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. Jesus. Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?

I said the keys are in here. Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. Marty, that was very interesting music. Calvin.

What? Ahh. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. C'mon. Yeah okay.

Precisely. Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car.

Uh, Doc. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. Doc. I have to tell you about the future. How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't.

Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. He's your brother, Mom. Hello. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you?

What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay? The hell you doing to my car? C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. Now which one was it, Greg or Craig?

George, help me, please. Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? Sit here, Marty. The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue?

Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc. C'mon, c'mon. There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now.

Perfect, just perfect. Yeah, he's right here. Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? I think we need a rematch. Right.

Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. I have to tell you about the future. Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row. Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works.

Alright, take it up, go. Doc. Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? Leave her alone, you bastard. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything.

Yeah well, you shouldn't drink. Yeah, well history is gonna change. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Who?

Marty, are you alright? That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series. Don't tell me anything. Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after.

The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?

Alright, I'm ready. I have to tell you about the future. Whoa, this is heavy. Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Yeah, exactly.

Well, Biff. That's George McFly. No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. Crazy drunk drivers. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium.

Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? Why not? Marty you gotta come back with me. Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact.

Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called.

Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. What did I just say? Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? Which one's your pop?

Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. Next, please. You know what I do in those situations? You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. Ronald Reagon.

Uh, yeah. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? What about George? I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. Where does he come from?

Okay Doc, this is it. What a nightmare. Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. Children. Hello, Jennifer.

Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? Uh, coast guard. Right, I got it. I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance.

C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. Ahh. I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. Wait a minute. Um, yeah, I'm on my way.

It's about the future, isn't it? Excuse me. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. Okay. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something?

That's for messing up my hair. Who, who? About 30 years, it's a nice round number. Because, you might regret it later in life. How's your head?

Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright? Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. Let's go.

Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave. Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. Wow, you must be rich.

Where does he come from? Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. George.

There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium.

Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Oh.

Watch it, Goldie. Jennifer. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Yeah. We do now.

In that case, I'll tell you strait out. Hello. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics.

Actually, people call me Marty. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- What did you sleep in your clothes again last night. He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. Yeah, it's in the back.

Are you okay? I think I know exactly what you mean. Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature. Huh? George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything.

Hello. You got a permit for that? Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. You do?

Crazy drunk drivers. Hello. Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked. Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer.

Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day? Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear? This sounds pretty heavy. I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations.

Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? Well, I guess that's everything. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. Hello.

he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. God dammit, I'm late. Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. Uncle Jailbird Joey?

George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? Nothing's coming to my mind. Yeah, it's 8:00. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall?

Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. Oh, yeah, yeah. C'mon, c'mon let's go. What about George?

I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature. Jennifer. I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations.

What's going on? Where have you been all week? I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. Why do you keep following me around? What Lorraine, what? You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother?

Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. I will. You bet. Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine.

This sounds pretty heavy. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? We do now. Yeah okay. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that?

McFly. I'll get it back to you, alright? It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking. Aw yeah, everything is great. Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.

Scram, McFly. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Back to the future. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it.

Hey boy, are you alright? You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine.

Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. I have to tell you about the future. Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Aw yeah, everything is great.

What? I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. George, aren't you gonna kiss me? Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. I followed you.

I hope so. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. His head's gone, it's like it's been erased. We never would have fallen in love. Excuse me.

Ah well, sort of. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? What, I don't get what happened.

Yoo. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? Hey boy, are you alright?

No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. Alright, punk, now- George: you ever think of running for class president? What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. Jesus, you smoke too?

The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. Uh, you mean nobody's asked you?

Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties.

Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories. Marty, that was very interesting music. Oh.

Shit. Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. Ahh. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty.

That's right. Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Right, I got it. What? Where's Einstein, is he with you?

What's a rerun? Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing?

Oh. McFly. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? I followed you. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand?

Doc? I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. What did you sleep in your clothes again last night. Yeah. Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment.

Oh. Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. George. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Why am I always the last one to know about these things.

I have a feeling too. This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline? Erased from existence. Does your mom know about tomorrow night? I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours.

What? No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids. You got a permit for that? Look, you gotta listen to me. Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet.

Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? Mom, Dad. Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. Let's put him in there. Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope.

Stop it. Alright, I'm ready. Where? How's your head? Biff.

Marty, you made it. C'mon. Right check, Doc. Keys? You okay, is everything alright?

You okay, is everything alright? Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. C'mon, c'mon let's go. C'mon, c'mon.

Well yeah, you know we have two of them. And he could sleep in my room. Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.

What did you say? Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. Marty, that was very interesting music. What?

Whoa, whoa, okay. Ahh. C'mon, c'mon. Ah. Whoa. Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat?

Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Maybe you were adopted. Let's put him in there. Children.

Aw yeah, everything is great. Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake. Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars. Are you okay? You okay, is everything alright? There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?

Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. What you got under here? That's right, he's gonna be mayor.

And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? Yeah, I think maybe you do. Take care. His head's gone, it's like it's been erased.

oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? Where were we.

What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. Okay, but I don't know what to say. I don't wanna see you in here again.

Where were we. Whoa, this is heavy. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Yeah.

Excuse me. And he could sleep in my room. Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. No, not yet. Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it.

Who is that guy. Yeah okay. I think we need a rematch. Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. Wait a minute.

Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. I don't wanna see you in here again. Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you. C'mon, c'mon let's go. No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody.

Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. Well uh, good, fine. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble.

Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything.

Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh. That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. God dammit, I'm late. Doc, you gotta help- I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours.

Right, and where am I gonna be? Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you. Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- You bet. Oh.

Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. I haven't Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music.

Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Right. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him- This sounds pretty heavy.

Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. That's right, he's gonna be mayor. Without any sugar. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow.

Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Yeah. Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown.

I'm gonna ram him. Let's put him in there. Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility.

Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. The future, it's where you're going? It's already mutated into human form, shoot it. What you got under here?

Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. C'mon, c'mon let's go. The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social-

Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date. Damn. I'm late for school. Now Biff, don't con me. It's a board with wheels. Marty, why are you so nervous?

I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. Marty you gotta come back with me. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? Get your meat hooks off of me. Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George?

Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me? Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show.

Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. What the hell is a gigawatt? And where's my reports? It's about the future, isn't it? Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her.

Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line. Yeah well, you shouldn't drink. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. Just finishing up the second coat now.

Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? George, help me, please. I've gotta go. Doc, is that a de- Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world.

Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. Thanks a lot, kid.

I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? Okay. I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it.

Say that again. You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head?

Never? His head's gone, it's like it's been erased. What's that thing he's on? Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? Quiet.

I hope so. Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. And he could sleep in my room. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. Good morning.

Precisely. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. She's just trying to keep you respectable. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. No.

Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind. You too. I followed you. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary?

That's George McFly. Yeah, it's 8:00. Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed.

Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. Go. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955.

Really. Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. Ahh. That's a great idea. I'd love to park. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing?

You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town. Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. Yeah. That's him.

I'll get it back to you, alright? This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. Bet your ass it works. Doc, wait. No, bastards. Oh yes sir.

Where's Einstein, is he with you? Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something.

Lorraine, are you up there? Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.

That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series. Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. McFly. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.

George: you ever think of running for class president? Marty, are you alright? Wait a minute. You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc. Oh.

My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Ahh. Yeah. That's a big bruise you have there. Yeah.

Never mind that now, never mind that now. Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. You'll find out. What? Hi.

Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? Bet your ass it works. Oh. Are you okay? Don't say a word.

George, aren't you gonna kiss me? My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? Well, she's not doing a very good job. Ahh. Leave me alone.

Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. Uh, I think so. Excuse me. Look, you gotta listen to me. Go.

The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social- Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. I think we need a rematch.

Watch it, Goldie. The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social- What did you say? Yeah, he's right here. Good morning, Mom.

Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? I, I don't know. Weight has nothing to do with it. Go.

Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. I think I know exactly what you mean. Yeah, he's right here. How about a ride, Mister?

Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. Yeah, where does he live? I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. God dammit, I'm late. Mom, Dad.

Whoa, wait, Doc. Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her. Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Yeah. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties.

No, fine, no , good, fine, good. I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? Oh, yeah, yeah. And he could sleep in my room. Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need.

Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. I'm gonna ram him.

Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. Where does he come from? Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me?

Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Jesus. Why not? Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody. Right, and where am I gonna be?

Okay Doc, this is it. Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Why do you keep following me around? Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon.

Okay. Jesus. Let's put him in there. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. Hi.

Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. Huh? Yeah. You bet. Why do you keep following me around?

Its good. Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Damn. I'm late for school.

You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. Now which one was it, Greg or Craig? Thanks a lot, kid.

Wrecked? Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. Thanks, thanks a lot.

Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. You bet. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny. Never mind that now, never mind that now.

Yet. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Precisely.

Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked. Hello, Jennifer. Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. What was it, George, bird watching? Who do you think, the Libyans.

Uh? Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? Oh.

Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Get your meat hooks off of me. Nothing's coming to my mind. Right check, Doc.

The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Uh, well, I gotta go. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying.

Yeah. Now Biff, don't con me. Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline? Right.

I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. Huh? Um, yeah, I'm on my way.

Weight has nothing to do with it. What's with the life preserver? That's a big bruise you have there. Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. What did you say?

A colored mayor, that'll be the day. Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Marty, are you alright? Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother.

Whoa, this is heavy. Uh, coast guard. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. In that case, I'll tell you strait out. Right check, Doc.

We all make mistakes in life, children I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. Take care. The future, it's where you're going?

Chuck, Chuck, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Berry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this. Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? Oh, what I meant to day was- Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here.

Because, you might regret it later in life. I have to tell you about the future. Oh. Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine. Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady.

It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. I just wanna use the phone. Well gee, I don't know. Just finishing up the second coat now.

You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. No, fine, no , good, fine, good. 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. That's right, he's gonna be mayor. Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh.

Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social- I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you.

Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. Take care.

Well, this is a radiation suit. Go. Go. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. I have to tell you about the future. Where does he come from?

C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. Huh? Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her- Let's put him in there.

Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all.

Damn. I'm late for school. Precisely. Precisely. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- No.

Good morning. George. What a nightmare. Say that again. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you?

No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing? Well, they're bigger than me. Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day. Where?

I, I don't know. Yeah. Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc.

Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Hello. Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Perfect, just perfect. It's a board with wheels.

That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. Yeah, where does he live? George. What's going on? Where have you been all week?

What? That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. How's your head? That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it.

That's right, he's gonna be mayor. No, Doc. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. Aw yeah, everything is great.

What, what is it hot? I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? No, why, what's a matter?

Yeah, it's 8:00. Whoa, whoa, okay. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. He's your brother, Mom. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need.

Yoo. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Doc? C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. Because, you might regret it later in life.

Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after. C'mon.

C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. The storm. Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. Perfect, just perfect. You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother?

Right, I got it. You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show. Did you hurt your head? What, well you mean like a date? Just finishing up the second coat now.

George, help me, please. Oh. Do you mind if we park for a while? The storm. Uh, coast guard.

I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Yeah well, you shouldn't drink. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Huh? Yeah, well history is gonna change.

Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. I guarantee it. Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. Yeah.

That's George McFly? C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. Uncle Jailbird Joey? Stop it. Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around.

Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. No. Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo What's with the life preserver? Right, I got it.

That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. Its good. Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary?

There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? Precisely. Its good. Doc.

He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. A colored mayor, that'll be the day. Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? What, what? Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand.

I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. Lorraine, are you up there? My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics.

That's a great idea. I'd love to park. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance. Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you. Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage.

You're gonna be in the car with her. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house.

Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. What? Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor.

Oh, yeah, yeah. Marty, will we ever see you again? This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine.

Yeah. What, well you mean like a date? Ah. Whoa. Who? Shit.

Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Now Biff, don't con me.

Listen, Doc. What, what is it hot? He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet.

Marty, that was very interesting music. Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties?

Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day? There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Children. Because, you might regret it later in life. Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life.

The flux capacitor. Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line.

Marty you gotta come back with me. George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? What's that thing he's on? What? Holy shit.

Marty, are you alright? Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? Right. Oh. Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born.

Because, you might regret it later in life. Leave her alone, you bastard. Crazy drunk drivers. Nothing. Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown.

1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. What you got under here? When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What?

That's good advice, Marty. Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. Crazy drunk drivers. C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?

Listen, Doc. Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow. Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. What, well you mean like a date?

Right check, Doc. I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy. Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me? Excuse me. Ohh, no.

Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. I just wanna use the phone.

No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin. Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? Alright, we're the pinheads. Looks like a airplane, without wings.

George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? That's right, he's gonna be mayor. You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. The hell you doing to my car? Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother.

What's going on? Where have you been all week? Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? Whoa, wait, Doc. Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. I'm gonna ram him.

Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance. Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug. Well, this is a radiation suit.

Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave. Why not? That's him. What? Hi.

Uh, yeah. Oh, what I meant to day was- Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. And he could sleep in my room.

Ohh, no. Who do you think, the Libyans. Well, they're bigger than me. I will. Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984.

Hey. Keys? Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television?

The hell you doing to my car? The flux capacitor. Yeah, sure, okay. Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. Will you take care of that?

Marty, why are you so nervous? Right. Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave. That's George McFly.

Jesus, you smoke too? What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. Breakfast.

I'll get it back to you, alright? Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? We all make mistakes in life, children Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody.

Alright, I'm ready. Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear? I'll get it back to you, alright? Are you okay? Yeah.

Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. What, what is it hot? You broke it. Wow, look at him go. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy.

I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. What, what, ma? Quiet. Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.

Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. Oh. It's my dad. Who, who? Who, who?

Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? Oh. That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him- Who's are these? The flux capacitor.

Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance. Yeah. I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it.

C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. Precisely. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Uh, coast guard. That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series.

Will you take care of that? Well, she's not doing a very good job. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car.

How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house.

I think I know exactly what you mean. Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium. That's good advice, Marty. Bet your ass it works.

Let's put him in there. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed. Ohh, no. Weight has nothing to do with it. 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma.

What? It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked.

Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. Where the hell are they. Hey boy, are you alright? What, what?

What did your mother ever see in that kid? I just wanna use the phone. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing? Maybe you were adopted. Yeah.

Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? Hello. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin. Maybe you were adopted.

Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? Doc, she didn't even look at him. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. Who's are these? Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything.

Now Biff, don't con me. What did your mother ever see in that kid? Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now.

Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? What, I don't get what happened. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. It's a board with wheels.

What did you sleep in your clothes again last night. It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking. Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her. Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time?

Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Just finishing up the second coat now. Right. Right check, Doc. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked.

That's a great idea. I'd love to park. I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. I have to tell you about the future. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload.

Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. Oh. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you.

What? That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. What Lorraine, what? Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational.

The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. Ahh. Calvin.

Good morning. Hello. I have to tell you about the future. Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?

Yeah, who are you? C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. Go. Go. Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly.

What, well you mean like a date? Wait a minute. Wrecked? When did this happen and- Biff. Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life?

And where's my reports? On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. Doc. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload.

That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. Whoa, this is heavy. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you?

Yeah. Why not? Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. Uh, well, I gotta go. Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man.

Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. Yeah. Yeah, it's 8:00. Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it.

That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. What the hell is a gigawatt? I'll call you tonight. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley.

Hey. I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. George.

A colored mayor, that'll be the day. Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you. No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. Don't say a word.

You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. Yeah. Who do you think, the Libyans. Are you okay?

Who do you think, the Libyans. This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. It's my dad. Right. Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance.

Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. Let's get him. Damn. I'm late for school. Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave. Yeah, sure, okay.

Ah, where're my pants? Let's go. What? C'mon, c'mon let's go. He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life.

Shit. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. No, Biff, you leave her alone. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.

Where were we. That ain't no airplane, look. Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. Ah well, sort of. Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off?

That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series. I can't play. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Children. Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you.

Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you? Oh. So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you?

Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. Yeah, I think maybe you do. Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. Let's go. I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody.

I have to tell you about the future. Oh. Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? That ain't no airplane, look. C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil.

Are you okay? Well, they're bigger than me. Did you hurt your head? Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house.

I think we need a rematch. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Are you okay? Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it.

Are you sure about this storm? Well, she's not doing a very good job. Hi, Marty. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Shit.

George. George. Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me?

Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? Doc. No, I refuse to except the responsibility. Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. Right about here.

Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? Hey boy, are you alright? Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. Jennifer.

I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload.

Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. Without any sugar. Doc. Marty, that was very interesting music. C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil.

I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- What? Wow, you must be rich. Do you mind if we park for a while? George.

Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike. He's a very strange young man.

What Lorraine, what? Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. Why is she gonna get angry with you? Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be.

My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you. Ronald Reagon. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand?

I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? Ah well, sort of. George. Ohh, no.

Right, I got it. Don't say a word. What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Holy shit.

Well, they're bigger than me. What you got under here? Just finishing up the second coat now. Yeah, it's 8:00. No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody.

Let's put him in there. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. Sit here, Marty. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar.

Are you sure about this storm? Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody. Whoa, whoa, okay.

I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. The flux capacitor. Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. Doc.

Whoa, whoa, okay. Thank you. In about thirty years. I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date. Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.

Jennifer. What, what is it hot? I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. Excuse me.

Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? I'm gonna ram him. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. It's about the future, isn't it? Yeah, exactly.

Excuse me. Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't.

Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. About 30 years, it's a nice round number. Are you sure about this storm? Don't say a word.

You know what I do in those situations? Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday. Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything.

That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day. Oh. I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. Yeah, it's in the back.

Leave her alone, you bastard. It's my dad. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple. Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please.

Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. Whoa, whoa, okay. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. Yeah okay.

Does your mom know about tomorrow night? That's a great idea. I'd love to park. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? What's the meaning of this. Good morning.

Don't say a word. Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? Right, gimme a Pepsi free. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright?

Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. Why not? Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything.

Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. How's your head? Marty, you made it. Watch it, Goldie. Uh, I think so.

You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc. No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. Flux capacitor. Because, you might regret it later in life. He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches.

Where? C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. Right. Without any sugar. Where does he come from?

Right, and where am I gonna be? Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine.

How's your head? Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day. Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight. Jesus, you smoke too?

Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? Wait a minute. Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all.

No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible. Sit here, Marty. You broke it. Wow, look at him go. No, Doc. Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it.

1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike. Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind-

Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. Who is that guy.

Good morning, Mom. Are those my clocks I hear? About how far ahead are you going? Oh. Yeah, who are you?

I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- Uh? I'm gonna ram him. The flux capacitor.

Don't tell me anything. Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you. Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight. About 30 years, it's a nice round number. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater.

Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear? Hello. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. Let him go, Biff, you're drunk.

Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. I think we need a rematch. Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me?

Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. I don't wanna see you in here again. Well uh, good, fine. Uh, yeah. C'mon.

No, Doc. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. Uh, coast guard.

Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. Listen, Doc. There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now. Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. Calvin.

Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day? Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh. Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. Um, yeah, I'm on my way.

You broke it. Wow, look at him go. I'll call you tonight. Doc, wait. No, bastards. What was it, George, bird watching? What, what?

Yeah. Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Marty. Marty. Marty. No.

Without any sugar. Where's Einstein, is he with you? Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. Just finishing up the second coat now. Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody.

You too. Right. Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright?

Maybe you were adopted. Yeah, gimme a Tab. Are those my clocks I hear? Yoo. Right, I got it.

No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin. I guarantee it. Marty, why are you so nervous? Biff. And he could sleep in my room.

Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day. Breakfast. Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break.

Yeah, it's 8:00. Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Excuse me. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy.

There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? I have to tell you about the future. I just wanna use the phone. Yeah okay. Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo

Alright, I'm ready. Thanks a lot, kid. Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny. Well, I figured, what the hell.

There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time?

Why not? Huh? What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? Biff.

This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. Hello, Jennifer. Let's put him in there. Uh, look me up when you get there.

I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. Wrecked? When did this happen and- Really. You too. Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape.

Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. Uh, I think so. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Aw yeah, everything is great. Maybe you were adopted.

Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. What the hell is this? Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. How's your head? Who do you think, the Libyans.

Ahh. I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. Who do you think, the Libyans. Wrecked? Is she pretty?

Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? Marty, such a nice name. Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind. Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda I've gotta go.

Right. Biff. Will you take care of that? Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing.

Next, please. Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on.

Scram, McFly. No. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Never mind that now, never mind that now.

Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. You broke it. Wow, look at him go. Look, you gotta listen to me. Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date. Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan.

Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- Yeah. Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire?

Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance. Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh.

Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? What's going on? Where have you been all week? Just finishing up the second coat now. Well uh, good, fine. Doc.

Jesus, you smoke too? No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. Okay, but I don't know what to say. Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared.

Oh. Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. We never would have fallen in love. Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me.

Oh yes sir. Do you mind if we park for a while? Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty.

Well gee, I don't know. Right, gimme a Pepsi free. You broke it. Wow, look at him go. I have to tell you about the future. What's with the life preserver?

You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. God dammit, I'm late. Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright? Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that?

No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. What's with the life preserver? Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. Huh? What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else.

It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night.

I will. I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids.

You broke it. Wow, look at him go. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. Yeah okay. Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat.

You do? Yeah, it's in the back. Working. Stop it. Huh?

Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where.

Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. And where's my reports? My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Hello, Jennifer.

What a nightmare. About how far ahead are you going? Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine. You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother? So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here.

God dammit, I'm late. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? Ahh. Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly?

Right check, Doc. Hello. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called.

Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Why not? Jennifer. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.

I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. You do? Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car.

He's a peeping tom. Dad. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? No. Right.

Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright? How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar.

Uh? Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? I think we need a rematch. No.

What did your mother ever see in that kid? Doc, you gotta help- That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. Right.

What, well you mean like a date? Thanks, thanks a lot. Where does he come from? Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day? What did you sleep in your clothes again last night.

Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. Uncle Jailbird Joey? Ahh. Ronald Reagon. No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody.

Unroll their fire. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. Marty, will we ever see you again? Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home.

Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. You got a permit for that? Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny.

Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. Jennifer. Precisely. Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine.

I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. No, fine, no , good, fine, good. Uh, I think so. I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. I have to tell you about the future.

Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Let's get him. Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry.

I have to tell you about the future. Uh, I think so. Yoo. Yeah. Scram, McFly.

Wow, you must be rich. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. Hi. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. He's alright.

Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Keys? Take care. C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. Right, gimme a Pepsi free.

he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. Good morning. Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date.

Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. We do now. Unroll their fire. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance.

Wrecked? When did this happen and- Yeah okay. Don't say a word. Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. Right about here.

Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? Aw yeah, everything is great. Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me?

Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. Listen, Doc. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.

Doc. Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.

Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. Marty, you made it. Marty, why are you so nervous? I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home.

C'mon, c'mon let's go. Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody. Go. Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music.

You're gonna be in the car with her. Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. Yeah, I think maybe you do. He's alright. Okay, but I don't know what to say.

I think we need a rematch. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? No, Doc. Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. Crazy drunk drivers.

You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. Yeah well, you shouldn't drink. Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. Doc. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun.

I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. Well yeah, you know we have two of them. That's good advice, Marty. Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it. Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them.

Breakfast. What did you say? Take care. Oh. No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin.

Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. Marty you gotta come back with me.

Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning. Maybe you were adopted. The flux capacitor. I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy.

Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. Huh? I guarantee it.

Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind. Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning. What? Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. Whoa, wait, Doc.

Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance. No, why, what's a matter? Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. Say that again. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world.

No, fine, no , good, fine, good. Who do you think, the Libyans. A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike. You'll find out in thirty years. Right.

Right. No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. I'm gonna be at the dance. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc.

The storm. Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked. Uh? I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair.

Yeah. whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it. So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985?

C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- Don't say a word. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that?

Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? The future, it's where you're going? Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. Whoa, this is heavy.

Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. I will. That's George McFly.

What Lorraine, what? Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. Really. Never? Uh, well, I gotta go.

Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. Thanks. Science Fiction Theater.

I think you got the wrong car, McFly. Yeah, it's in the back. That ain't no airplane, look. Let's go. Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon.

That's George McFly. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment.

Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. You broke it. Wow, look at him go. Ahh. I have to tell you about the future.

Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. Where the hell are they.

You got a permit for that? Holy shit. C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. Stop it. What's a rerun?

Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. C'mon, c'mon. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. Why am I always the last one to know about these things.

We do now. No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. Thank you. In about thirty years. Marty, are you alright? Shit.

Don't tell me anything. The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. Next, please. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day.

Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow. Hey kid, what you do, jump ship?

What did you say? Never? You're gonna be in the car with her. Alright, take it up, go. Doc. Hello.

Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you. Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed. I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours.

Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. This sounds pretty heavy. Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Your, your right.

Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... In that case, I'll tell you strait out.

Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day. Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space.

Let's put him in there. You know what I do in those situations? Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet.

Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? Oh yes sir. That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream.

Hello. Ah. Whoa. Will you take care of that? Okay. Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage.

That's a big bruise you have there. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry.

Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. Uh, well, I gotta go. Thanks a lot, kid. Flux capacitor.

Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake. Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. C'mon, c'mon let's go. Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you.

Keys? What the hell is a gigawatt? You're George McFly. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?

Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? Yeah, exactly. I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you. What?

Yeah, I think maybe you do. Alright, punk, now- You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. Because, you might regret it later in life. You're gonna be in the car with her.

Wow, you must be rich. Okay, but I don't know what to say. How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. Wait a minute. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space.

No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- We do now. I'm gonna be at the dance. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age.

Really. Maybe you were adopted. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that.

What? What you got under here? Alright, take it up, go. Doc. Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium. Ahh.

Did you hurt your head? Jesus. Let's get him. I have to tell you about the future. Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her.

This is for all you lovers out there. What a nightmare. Next, please. Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son.

Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. I have to tell you about the future. Looks like a airplane, without wings. This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline? Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong?

I'll get it back to you, alright? Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. Nothing's coming to my mind. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties.

Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Crazy drunk drivers. Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds.

The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? What? Is she pretty? this has gotta be a dream. What a nightmare.

Let's put him in there. It's already mutated into human form, shoot it. Ah, where're my pants? McFly. This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future.

No, Biff, you leave her alone. Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. C'mon, c'mon let's go. What's that thing he's on?

Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. this has gotta be a dream. Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. Good morning. Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas.

George. Uh? I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas.

What did I just say? No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- Ahh. George, aren't you gonna kiss me? Go. Go.

I don't wanna see you in here again. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. Ahh. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter.

Leave her alone, you bastard. Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. And he could sleep in my room. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that?

Nothing's coming to my mind. Did you hurt your head? Marty. Marty. Marty. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother.

oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. Why do you keep following me around? Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please.

Nothing. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date?

Right, gimme a Pepsi free. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- Okay. Marty, are you alright?

You got a permit for that? Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. The keys are in the trunk. No. Doc.

It's my dad. Yeah. Well gee, I don't know. Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? That's a big bruise you have there.

Uh, Doc. Alright, we're the pinheads. What? That's for messing up my hair. Did you hurt your head?

Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? Um, yeah, I'm on my way. That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. Yeah, it's in the back.

Right about here. Breakfast. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. What? No.

It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple. Right. Why do you keep following me around? Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. Hey.

Mom, is that you? Oh yes sir. Breakfast. Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space.

Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. Ah, honey, your first novel. Yeah. Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin.

What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. You don't understand. Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Now which one was it, Greg or Craig?

It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Right about here. Ah. Whoa. Yeah.

What a nightmare. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home.

Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. You're gonna be in the car with her. Well, uh, listen, uh, I really- What? Doc, you gotta help-

She's just trying to keep you respectable. Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo Leave me alone. Uncle Jailbird Joey? Um, yeah, I'm on my way.

Yoo. What? Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. Why not?

Well uh, good, fine. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. Wow, you must be rich. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new.

Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. Oh yes sir. Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? Doc, is that a de-

You got a permit for that? Oh. Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row. Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked. I don't wanna see you in here again.

Jesus. Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. Is she pretty? Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. Lorenzo, where're you keys?

He's a peeping tom. Dad. Doc? No, I refuse to except the responsibility. Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. Well uh, good, fine.

Are you okay? You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. Unroll their fire.

Because, you might regret it later in life. You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town. Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Marty you gotta come back with me.

Doc, wait. No, bastards. C'mon, c'mon. C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. What's with the life preserver? I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future-

Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? Children. Doc. No, Biff, you leave her alone. Oh.

Whoa, this is heavy. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Hello. Yet. What's with the life preserver?

No. Lorraine. Erased from existence. Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that?

My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. Hello.

That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series. Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? Quiet.

He's a very strange young man. Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something?

Keys? Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. I'm gonna ram him.

Well, she's not doing a very good job. Where the hell are they. Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Let's get him.

The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? Are you okay? This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. Well, Biff.

Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright? Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. You okay, is everything alright? Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you. I haven't

Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? It's about the future, isn't it? Huh? Aw yeah, everything is great. Did you hurt your head?

Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. Yeah, sure, okay.

Okay. You broke it. Wow, look at him go. My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines. Well, she's not doing a very good job. About how far ahead are you going?

Flux capacitor. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. What did I just say?

No, fine, no , good, fine, good. Uh, coast guard. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Well, I figured, what the hell. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked.

No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Marty you gotta come back with me. Well gee, I don't know.

Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley.

What? Who, who? Damn. I'm late for school. Well gee, I don't know. Well yeah, you know we have two of them.

That's for messing up my hair. Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake. Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars. Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? Because, you might regret it later in life. Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight.

See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? Where the hell are they. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. How about a ride, Mister?

Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? Never? Well, I figured, what the hell. Uh? Marty, you made it.

Because, you might regret it later in life. I have to tell you about the future. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.

Breakfast. Who? Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? Yeah. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port?

But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying. Calvin. Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him.

C'mon, c'mon let's go. I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you. What did your mother ever see in that kid? That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh?

Well yeah, you know we have two of them. Huh? Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? Who, who? Jennifer.

And where's my reports? Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. Ah well, sort of. You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. Yeah well, you shouldn't drink.

Yeah. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. Yeah, sure, okay. Mom, Dad. Yeah, I think maybe you do.

Hello, Jennifer. No, bastards. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind. I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly.

Aw yeah, everything is great. Go. Go. No, why, what's a matter? Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope.

On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. What the hell is a gigawatt? Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. I think we need a rematch. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly?

Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. Uh, yeah. Stop it. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? George.

Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? Aw yeah, everything is great. Hello. Did you hurt your head? It's already mutated into human form, shoot it.

Uh, I think so. You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. McFly.

Do you mind if we park for a while? Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her. Where's Einstein, is he with you?

Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? Huh? Marty, that was very interesting music. I'm gonna ram him. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you?

Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? Uncle Jailbird Joey? It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible.

Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. Leave me alone. That's good advice, Marty.

Bet your ass it works. You got a permit for that? That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. Right, gimme a Pepsi free. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible.

After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Don't say a word. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here.

Your, your right. Hi, Marty. Stop it. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. What?

What, what is it hot? Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. This is for all you lovers out there. Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature. Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire?

You're George McFly. Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy. Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody.

You'll find out. A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Working. What's going on? Where have you been all week?

Where? Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. Doc, wait. No, bastards. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. This sounds pretty heavy.

Uh, look me up when you get there. C'mon, c'mon. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Look, you gotta listen to me. Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds.

I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- Are you gonna order something, kid? This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline? I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends.

Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Jesus.

Why do you keep following me around? Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- Did you hurt your head? Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay? Okay, but I don't know what to say.

Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. A colored mayor, that'll be the day. I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. I can't play.

Right. Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car. You don't understand.

It's about the future, isn't it? Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. Doc, you gotta help- What did your mother ever see in that kid? What did you sleep in your clothes again last night.

Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? Which one's your pop? Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine.

You don't understand. Oh. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it. What?

How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. Biff. That's right. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload.

Maybe you were adopted. Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. You okay, is everything alright? Jesus, you smoke too? You have this thing hooked up to the car?

1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. He's a very strange young man.

Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. Hello, Jennifer. Ahh. Alright, punk, now- Uh, you mean nobody's asked you?

George. Right. You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc. Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born.

Well, I figured, what the hell. Hello. Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. Who are you? He's your brother, Mom.

Do you mind if we park for a while? Breakfast. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Does your mom know about tomorrow night? Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown.

Ohh, no. That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. Leave her alone, you bastard. Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you.

What you got under here? Maybe you were adopted. Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine.

That's good advice, Marty. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. Huh? Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me.

Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Go. Go. Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be.

Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. The hell you doing to my car? Bet your ass it works. Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me.

Okay. Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. Oh. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything.

whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Huh? C'mon. You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week.

Precisely. You broke it. Wow, look at him go. Right. In that case, I'll tell you strait out. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this.

Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear? This sounds pretty heavy. Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. What did you sleep in your clothes again last night. Uh, yeah.

Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? I'm gonna be at the dance. Don't tell me anything. Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. What, what, ma?

C'mon, c'mon let's go. Ah, honey, your first novel. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. Yeah, who are you? Next, please.

Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Weight has nothing to do with it. Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed. Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind.

What? Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay? Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Hi, Marty. Ahh. Ahh.

Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it. You're George McFly. Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Yeah well, you shouldn't drink.

No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house? Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it.

Uh, yeah. That's George McFly? Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? Scram, McFly. C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety.

It's a board with wheels. Hello. Look, you gotta listen to me. Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Are you gonna order something, kid?

McFly. Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. I'll get it back to you, alright? Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair.

whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Just finishing up the second coat now. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- Right, I got it. Do you mind if we park for a while?

Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. Now Biff, don't con me. Stop it.

What about George? Stop it. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? It's already mutated into human form, shoot it.

Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. We never would have fallen in love. No, I refuse to except the responsibility. Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.

Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. Yeah, well history is gonna change. Breakfast. Ah well, sort of.

Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. Yeah. Hello. Does your mom know about tomorrow night? Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head?

That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh. Hello, Jennifer. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go.

I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. I can't play. Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay? Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe.

I have to tell you about the future. Where does he come from? Jennifer. Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television.

After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. What? Now Biff, don't con me. Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. Hello, Jennifer.

Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. Why is she gonna get angry with you? Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you.

1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. Right. Okay. I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you. Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts.

The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social- No, Biff, you leave her alone. What's going on? Where have you been all week? Oh yes sir. That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?

Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. I said the keys are in here. Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets.

You're gonna be in the car with her. Quiet. Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. I have a feeling too.

Well, I guess that's everything. Doc. No. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. Weight has nothing to do with it.

Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? George, help me, please. Right. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need.

Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Nothing. Right. Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents.

Why not? Ahh. Ahh. Okay Doc, this is it. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet.

Well gee, I don't know. In that case, I'll tell you strait out. No. Perfect, just perfect. No, fine, no , good, fine, good.

Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line. My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. What? Uh, yeah.

We all make mistakes in life, children What's a rerun? Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? Ahh.

Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. I said the keys are in here. What, what?

Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear? No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Doc, she didn't even look at him. Hello. I'll call you tonight.

Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after. My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. This sounds pretty heavy.

Save the clock tower. Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. What a nightmare. Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. Where?

Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break.

Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh. Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. Leave me alone. Yeah.

Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head.

Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. Wrecked? When did this happen and- Go. Go. Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh?

Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. It's my dad. This is for all you lovers out there. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop.

Hello. Doc, she didn't even look at him. Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me?

Is she pretty? Right. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. And he could sleep in my room. I'm gonna be at the dance.

Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. Yeah, exactly. No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids. What? What?

You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. Quiet. Yeah, he's right here. What?

Yeah. No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids. No, not yet. I think I know exactly what you mean. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything.

I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. I'm gonna ram him. Why is she gonna get angry with you? Maybe you were adopted. Uh, Doc.

Alright, we're the pinheads. Marty, why are you so nervous? It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple. Uh? Why am I always the last one to know about these things.

Who? Leave her alone, you bastard. Marty, such a nice name. Aw yeah, everything is great. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing?

Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? Ahh. Excuse me. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. Holy shit.

Crazy drunk drivers. Never mind that now, never mind that now. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here.

Where's Einstein, is he with you? What did I just say? Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after. Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god.

It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Are you okay? Ah, where're my pants? Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some.

It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. Working. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new.

What? That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. Never mind that now, never mind that now. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. What was it, George, bird watching?

Where does he come from? No, fine, no , good, fine, good. He's a very strange young man. Are you gonna order something, kid? And he could sleep in my room.

Um, well it's a delorean, right? How's your head? What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. Doc. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc.

Right. Don't say a word. Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. Ahh. What did I just say?

I, I don't know. Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date. You're gonna be in the car with her. Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin.

Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. Back to the future. Well, they're bigger than me. How's your head? I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible.

No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning. That's a big bruise you have there. Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. George. George.

Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. You're George McFly. Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown.

Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. I can't play.

I hope so. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike. My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines. What? Right.

Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. You bet. No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. Whoa, whoa, okay.

He's an absolute dream. Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it. I, I don't know. Oh, just a little weather experiment. Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music.

I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. Marty, such a nice name. C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.

Doc, you gotta help- Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you. Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. Who, who?

About how far ahead are you going? Yeah. Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. It's about the future, isn't it? I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later.

Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... Does your mom know about tomorrow night? Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? About how far ahead are you going? Doc.

Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you. Good morning, Mom. Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Well, Biff. You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home.

Whoa, this is heavy. Go. Go. Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? Damn. I'm late for school. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

Are you sure about this storm? You'll find out. What the hell is a gigawatt? Save the clock tower. Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time?

Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? What, well you mean like a date? No. Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row.

Unroll their fire. Actually, people call me Marty. Let's put him in there. Right. Uh, look me up when you get there.

Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? The keys are in the trunk. She's just trying to keep you respectable.

Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Alright, take it up, go. Doc. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny. Whoa, wait, Doc.

Well, they're bigger than me. You broke it. Wow, look at him go. You have this thing hooked up to the car? No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda

No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. What you got under here? Huh? What a nightmare. Go.

After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Doc? Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. Sit here, Marty. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties.

Uncle Jailbird Joey? Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. Let's put him in there. Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it.

Lorraine. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? Are you okay? What a nightmare.

We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc Jennifer. Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive.

Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine. You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother?

Alright, punk, now- You'll find out. Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun.

The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible. Yeah well, you shouldn't drink. What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. Doc.

Why not? Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age. You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too.

Look, you gotta listen to me. That's a big bruise you have there. Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. No, Biff, you leave her alone.

What a nightmare. Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. I have to tell you about the future.

Doc. Let's put him in there. The storm. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. Alright, punk, now-

Listen, Doc. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. Next, please. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Who?

Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. Who? It's my dad. Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that?

That's right. Good morning, Mom. Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. What? Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new.

Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. Right, I got it. Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn.

Yoo. Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. George: you ever think of running for class president? But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater.

Hey. What? That's George McFly? Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. This sounds pretty heavy.

I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. No, I refuse to except the responsibility. Thank you. In about thirty years. Look, you gotta listen to me. About how far ahead are you going?

Are those my clocks I hear? What, what, ma? Doc. Right about here. Huh?

Thanks a lot, kid. He's a very strange young man. No, Biff, you leave her alone. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?

Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. Ahh.

I said the keys are in here. Marty, you made it. Who do you think, the Libyans. My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. You bet.

Get your meat hooks off of me. Did you hurt your head? Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house? Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. The future, it's where you're going?

Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man. Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? How about a ride, Mister? Why is she gonna get angry with you? Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance.

C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. Ah, where're my pants? The keys are in the trunk. I've gotta go.

Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- Doc. I've gotta go. Uncle Jailbird Joey? Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born.

Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance. Where? I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. Look, you gotta listen to me.

Ah, where're my pants? Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. What was it, George, bird watching? Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor.

Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. Oh, just a little weather experiment. Who is that guy. Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born.

Yeah, gimme a Tab. Are you gonna order something, kid? Stop it. Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo

Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. A colored mayor, that'll be the day. You have this thing hooked up to the car? Well gee, I don't know.

Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. Yoo. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny.

Okay, but I don't know what to say. Precisely. Does your mom know about tomorrow night? Yeah, he's right here. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?

Marty, that was very interesting music. Huh? Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. Why not?

Who, who? No, why, what's a matter? Are you okay? We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. Oh.

Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave. Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. Doc, is that a de- About 30 years, it's a nice round number. Yeah, he's right here.

Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. Yet. I said the keys are in here. Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. Wrecked?

No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. Yeah, who are you? After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. That's a great idea. I'd love to park.

I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. Children. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before.

Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. No. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.

Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? He's a peeping tom. Dad.

Marty, will we ever see you again? Breakfast. No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. Well uh, good, fine. This is for all you lovers out there.

Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. A colored mayor, that'll be the day. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. Yeah, gimme a Tab. It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking.

Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks. Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. What?

Right. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. Who?

George. George. This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father. Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father. What? Oh, just a little weather experiment.

Wrecked? He's a very strange young man. Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance. Next, please.

Get your meat hooks off of me. Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Right, I got it. Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas...

George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. Jennifer. The hell you doing to my car? Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955.

Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man. Ronald Reagon. Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo Doc, you gotta help- I have a feeling too.

Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. No. You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life.

Oh yes sir. McFly. I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. Right, and where am I gonna be? So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here.

George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. George, help me, please. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Well gee, I don't know.

Look, you gotta listen to me. Okay Doc, this is it. Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after. Marty, will we ever see you again? Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance.

Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it. You don't understand. Well, uh, listen, uh, I really- Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity-

Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Next, please. It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet.

Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? How's your head? Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god.

I said the keys are in here. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. Yeah. He's a peeping tom. Dad. Yeah, who are you?

Working. Unroll their fire. Okay Doc, this is it. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. What, I don't get what happened.

Yoo. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Sit here, Marty. Jennifer.

Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. Nothing's coming to my mind. Well, I figured, what the hell.

Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? Thanks, thanks a lot. I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother? No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him.

Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature. Actually, people call me Marty. Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. What did you say?

Yeah, exactly. Who is that guy. he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, sure, okay.

Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo Working. What? Next, please. I'm gonna ram him.

My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. You know what I do in those situations? Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them.

That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright? That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. Without any sugar. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.

My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? What Lorraine, what? I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid.

That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. Hey boy, are you alright? What? And he could sleep in my room. Alright, I'm ready.

Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. It's a board with wheels. Right, and where am I gonna be? Weight has nothing to do with it. You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it.

No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. It's a board with wheels. This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. Sit here, Marty. Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage?

Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. Marty, are you alright? Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly.

His head's gone, it's like it's been erased. See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. We all make mistakes in life, children Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Good morning.

Ahh. Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here? So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. Bet your ass it works. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there?

I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Next, please. Never? Who do you think, the Libyans.

C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. Who? Erased from existence. C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. Are you okay?

Okay, but I don't know what to say. Doc. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. The future, it's where you're going?

Breakfast. No. Well uh, good, fine. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? Right.

That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him- Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house? Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? McFly.

Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. What's going on? Where have you been all week? Excuse me. That ain't no airplane, look. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one.

Erased from existence. Perfect, just perfect. What, well you mean like a date? This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there?

What did you sleep in your clothes again last night. I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now. I followed you. Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin?

Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. Who is that guy. You okay, is everything alright? You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother.

Ronald Reagon. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible.

Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. Why is she gonna get angry with you? My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space.

Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh. Now Biff, don't con me. How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it?

Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age. Flux capacitor. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind-

Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. Yoo. I have to tell you about the future. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Ahh.

Weight has nothing to do with it. Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. Ah, where're my pants? Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house.

Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. Marty, that was very interesting music. Right check, Doc. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that?

He's alright. We all make mistakes in life, children Marty, are you alright? Yeah, where does he live? Lorenzo, where're you keys?

The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social- Never mind that now, never mind that now. Are those my clocks I hear? Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh. I just wanna use the phone.

The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social- Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. How about a ride, Mister?

That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. Go. I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy. Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. C'mon, c'mon let's go.

Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. Right. Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. No, Biff, you leave her alone.

We all make mistakes in life, children Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. No, not yet. Is she pretty? Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared.

Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind. Well uh, good, fine. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. I followed you. Who is that guy.

It's about the future, isn't it? That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? What's the meaning of this. Marty you gotta come back with me. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you?

Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called.

It's about the future, isn't it? Does your mom know about tomorrow night? Look, you gotta listen to me. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here.

Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. Marty, that was very interesting music. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week.

He's an absolute dream. Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father. Leave her alone, you bastard. You bet.

Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Who? That's good advice, Marty. And he could sleep in my room. I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you.

Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. You're George McFly. Doc? Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- What's that thing he's on?

Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. That ain't no airplane, look. Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it. Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? Excuse me.

No, I refuse to except the responsibility. Marty, that was very interesting music. That's George McFly? What's a rerun? Doc, wait. No, bastards.

Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. He's an absolute dream.

One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? I said the keys are in here. I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you.

But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying. Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. You don't understand. Ahh. Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985.

What's the meaning of this. A colored mayor, that'll be the day. Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. I think we need a rematch.

That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. What's with the life preserver? Hello.

Look, you gotta listen to me. Precisely. You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all.

So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear?

Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Marty, is that you? Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? Well gee, I don't know.

Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Marty, such a nice name. Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. C'mon, c'mon let's go.

Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- This is for all you lovers out there. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Take care.

Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. Right check, Doc. Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. Does your mom know about tomorrow night? Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks.

He's a very strange young man. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh.

Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. Shit. He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda

Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her. McFly. Are you okay?

Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you? Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. Look, you gotta listen to me. My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on.

Marty, will we ever see you again? Oh yes sir. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. No, not yet.

You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. Yeah, well history is gonna change. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Are you sure about this storm? Well uh, good, fine.

But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? Uh? Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? Ah, where're my pants? You bet.

No, I refuse to except the responsibility. Good morning, Mom. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. Yeah, it's 8:00.

Uncle Jailbird Joey? And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. Scram, McFly. I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours.

Without any sugar. You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show. Hello. Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets. You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it.

Actually, people call me Marty. Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. Lorraine. That's a big bruise you have there. Working.

No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. Do you mind if we park for a while? No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father. Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance.

Precisely. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed. Leave her alone, you bastard. Shit. Good morning.

Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. Hey boy, are you alright? What, what is it hot? Jennifer. Because, you might regret it later in life.

Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. Say that again. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?

No. He's a very strange young man. Thanks, thanks a lot. Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her.

You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. Well, this is a radiation suit. Why is she gonna get angry with you? What? Right, and where am I gonna be?

Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. George: you ever think of running for class president? You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. Alright, take it up, go. Doc.

Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay? Yeah. Yeah, he's right here. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous.

Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh. Go. Go. Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. Okay. Just finishing up the second coat now.

Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. Yeah well, you shouldn't drink. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine.

Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. Well, she's not doing a very good job. Which one's your pop? That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?

I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. Yeah, I think maybe you do. Lorraine, are you up there? He's an absolute dream. I will.

Okay Doc, this is it. C'mon. We all make mistakes in life, children Huh? I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car.

That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him- Doc, you gotta help- Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage.

Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. That ain't no airplane, look. Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble.

Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. That's George McFly. Yeah, who are you?

Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. Right, I got it. No, Doc. What, well you mean like a date? Biff.

Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here? She's just trying to keep you respectable. Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance.

Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Yeah. I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. Leave her alone, you bastard. Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat.

Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date. Good morning. You okay, is everything alright? Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets.

Breakfast. That's right. Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. And where's my reports? My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload.

Who do you think, the Libyans. Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. Oh. Uh, you mean nobody's asked you?

C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy. When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you?

And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. Wrecked? When did this happen and- Back to the future. I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. What's with the life preserver?

No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine. Next, please. No, Doc.

Right about here. I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? He's a peeping tom. Dad.

In that case, I'll tell you strait out. You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother? Nothing's coming to my mind. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. That's good advice, Marty.

Thanks. I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. Wrecked? Yeah, it's in the back. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow.

Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance. Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? His head's gone, it's like it's been erased.

Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. We never would have fallen in love. A colored mayor, that'll be the day. Marty, that was very interesting music. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.

He's a peeping tom. Dad. Ah, where're my pants? Ahh. Doc? Oh.

A colored mayor, that'll be the day. Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. C'mon. About how far ahead are you going? I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home.

Doc. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. Doc. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. He's a very strange young man.

Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. God dammit, I'm late. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Thank you. In about thirty years.

Right. I just wanna use the phone. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. Jesus, you smoke too?

I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. What? Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? Well yeah, you know we have two of them.

Oh. C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. Okay. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? The storm.

Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George?

Why not? You have this thing hooked up to the car? Oh. Listen, Doc. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you.

What? What's going on? Where have you been all week? Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago.

So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. Well, this is a radiation suit. Looks like a airplane, without wings. About how far ahead are you going? Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating?

It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing?

There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Thanks, thanks a lot.

Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? No, Doc. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. Marty, you made it. Excuse me.

Uh, well, I gotta go. That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? Marty, will we ever see you again? What's a rerun? No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody.

George, aren't you gonna kiss me? Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? George. Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike.

You have this thing hooked up to the car? Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? Now which one was it, Greg or Craig? No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?

What about George? I guarantee it. George. George. I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue?

I think you got the wrong car, McFly. Marty, why are you so nervous? Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. C'mon, c'mon. Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown.

Well gee, I don't know. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. Stop it. Whoa, this is heavy.

Hello. Weight has nothing to do with it. Ahh. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world.

Get your meat hooks off of me. No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. Thanks a lot, kid. It's about the future, isn't it? Ah, where're my pants?

Marty, you made it. C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. Right, I got it. Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches.

You got a permit for that? Yeah. Why not? Yeah, sure, okay. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house.

Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. No, Biff, you leave her alone. Doc, you gotta help- Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl.

What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Do you mind if we park for a while? Doc. Marty, why are you so nervous? Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear?

That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. Precisely. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car.

I think I know exactly what you mean. C'mon. What's with the life preserver? It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her.

God dammit, I'm late. A colored mayor, that'll be the day. Let's get him. Uh, yeah. Mom, is that you?

Yeah, where does he live? Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be.

Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. Well, I figured, what the hell. Leave me alone. Right. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine.

You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. Mom, Dad. Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright? This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday.

Hello. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? Hello.

Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. Marty, is that you? It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Right. Crazy drunk drivers.

Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Back to the future. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day?

Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? I'll get it back to you, alright? Why not?

Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning. Why is she gonna get angry with you? Hello. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny. Watch it, Goldie.

Oh yes sir. Hello. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. What about George? Well, I figured, what the hell.

Lorraine, are you up there? Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? McFly. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. Marty you gotta come back with me.

Doc, she didn't even look at him. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. Yeah. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Who is that guy.

Doc, you gotta help- whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. He's a peeping tom. Dad. Scram, McFly. Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you.

Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- You'll find out in thirty years. Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. Bet your ass it works. Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me.

The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social- Crazy drunk drivers. Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine. Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? Yeah.

Uh, well, I gotta go. George. George. Really. Uh, I think so. You have this thing hooked up to the car?

Hello. No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin. No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids. I have to tell you about the future. Ahh.

Why is she gonna get angry with you? Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you? My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple.

George. My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. Who do you think, the Libyans. About 30 years, it's a nice round number. Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need.

What? Uh, yeah. No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it.

Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you. The hell you doing to my car? Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. Hello. Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need.

McFly. I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. Right. Without any sugar. My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on.

Aw yeah, everything is great. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. What? Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row. Doc.

Yeah, I think maybe you do. Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her- Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? Flux capacitor.

Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay? Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? And where's my reports? This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline? You okay, is everything alright?

Ah well, sort of. You got a permit for that? You have this thing hooked up to the car? She's just trying to keep you respectable. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that.

A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? Unroll their fire. Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. Marty, why are you so nervous?

He's alright. Excuse me. Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? Marty, that was very interesting music. What, what, ma?

My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. It's a board with wheels. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind-

I, I don't know. I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. Its good. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed.

Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. Right, gimme a Pepsi free. Thanks a lot, kid.

I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. Watch it, Goldie. Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? You got a permit for that?

Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. I, I don't know.

Why not? Oh. What, what is it hot? Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you? No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible.

Hello. I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown.

Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? No. Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance. I, I don't know. Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book.

Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her- Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? That's George McFly. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25?

I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you. Marty, such a nice name. Jesus, you smoke too? That ain't no airplane, look.

This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. Yeah, where does he live?

Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. Yeah, sure, okay. He's a peeping tom. Dad.

And where's my reports? Never mind that now, never mind that now. Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. That's good advice, Marty.

You'll find out in thirty years. Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? How's your head? Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing?

Is she pretty? They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow. George, help me, please. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. Marty, such a nice name.

I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- Jesus. You too. You're gonna be in the car with her. You're gonna be in the car with her.

Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? You'll find out. Uh, look me up when you get there. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood.

Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. What? Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? Jesus.

Ah, where're my pants? Yeah, gimme a Tab. Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison.

Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? Right. Marty, you made it. It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple. I have to tell you about the future.

The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social- About 30 years, it's a nice round number. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. We do now.

Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Let's get him. Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time.

Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- Scram, McFly. George, aren't you gonna kiss me? Jesus, you smoke too? Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat?

Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it. Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. In that case, I'll tell you strait out.

Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. Thanks.

He's a peeping tom. Dad. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. What was it, George, bird watching? Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? Keys?

You're gonna be in the car with her. How's your head? Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Why not? Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed.

Its good. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. Excuse me. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed.

Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. No, fine, no , good, fine, good. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. I have to tell you about the future.

Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. You have this thing hooked up to the car? Doc?

Go. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. Well gee, I don't know. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here.

Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? That's George McFly. Uh, well, I gotta go. Where does he come from? Who do you think, the Libyans.

Without any sugar. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? Why is she gonna get angry with you? Thanks, thanks a lot.

No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking. Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. We never would have fallen in love.

Which one's your pop? Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow.

Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave. He's a very strange young man. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. The future, it's where you're going? What?

Oh. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. Bet your ass it works.

Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Say that again. Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind. No, I refuse to except the responsibility. Doc?

Right. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all.

Hello, Jennifer. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you. Yeah. Right, gimme a Pepsi free.

Do you mind if we park for a while? Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. Yet. Stop it. No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him.

My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. Doc, wait. No, bastards. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car.

Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay? Yeah, he's right here. No, fine, no , good, fine, good. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon.

Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? I think you got the wrong car, McFly. Maybe you were adopted.

Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social- Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? Marty, are you alright?

Yeah. Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. Did you hurt your head?

Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Biff. Good morning. Lorenzo, where're you keys? Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George?

About 30 years, it's a nice round number. George. Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine. One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. Alright, punk, now-

Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Yeah, where does he live? Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some.

What did I just say? Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. C'mon, c'mon. Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago.

Lorraine, are you up there? No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. Yeah, well history is gonna change. You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. Uh, well, I gotta go.

David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. Hello. That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series. Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing?

Shit. Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. Ah well, sort of. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Ohh, no.

Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? Right, I got it. Yeah, gimme a Tab.

Where the hell are they. Maybe you were adopted. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? Watch it, Goldie. This sounds pretty heavy.

Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. You do? I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories. Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it.

Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. What you got under here? Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? No, Doc. Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay.

Back to the future. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. I guarantee it. Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. Marty, that was very interesting music.

What did you say? Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Hello.

That's a great idea. I'd love to park. Alright, take it up, go. Doc. C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it.

Well, uh, listen, uh, I really- Flux capacitor. That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him- Let's go. Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans.

My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. Well gee, I don't know. Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. Yeah, exactly.

The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? I've gotta go. Yeah. You got a permit for that? He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches.

Hi. Well, this is a radiation suit. Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine. No. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy.

Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. Well, I figured, what the hell. The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine.

Sit here, Marty. Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. Alright, we're the pinheads. The hell you doing to my car?

Maybe you were adopted. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. Say that again. Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen.

You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother? Right. He's an absolute dream. Excuse me. Who's are these?

David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. I'll get it back to you, alright? Lorenzo, where're you keys?

What did you say? Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. Right, gimme a Pepsi free. Why not? Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly?

Thanks. You broke it. Wow, look at him go. I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? What, what?

Go. He's a peeping tom. Dad. Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? Look, you gotta listen to me.

Oh. Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row. He's a peeping tom. Dad. Yeah, who are you? What?

George. Well yeah, you know we have two of them. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955.

Leave me alone. What did you say? George, aren't you gonna kiss me? whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. What, what is it hot?

Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? Doc, is that a de- What the hell is a gigawatt? Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall.

Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets. Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks. Hi, Marty. You're gonna be in the car with her. Calvin.

And where's my reports? C'mon. No, fine, no , good, fine, good. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car.

Save the clock tower. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. He's a peeping tom. Dad. Marty, you made it. Right.

Does your mom know about tomorrow night? Who, who? Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay? My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun.

Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. Will you take care of that? On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. What? He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life.

Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me? Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? Without any sugar. Whoa, wait, Doc.

About how far ahead are you going? Ah. Doc. Back to the future. Damn. I'm late for school.

Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. Wait a minute. Yeah.

Yeah. Right, and where am I gonna be? What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. What did you say? One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott.

Um, well it's a delorean, right? C'mon, c'mon. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. You have this thing hooked up to the car? Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something.

Marty, why are you so nervous? Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me
